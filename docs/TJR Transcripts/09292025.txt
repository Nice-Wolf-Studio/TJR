All right, guys. Let's get into it. Um, market's about to open. We have super
0:09
bearish confluences off RIP. So, NASDAQ has failed to sweep out these highs
0:14
right here on the 4 hour while ES has already swept them out. So, a high time frame bearish SMT in confluence with a
0:21
low time frame bearish SMT on ES being the leading index on this.
0:26
So, from this high down to this high, we're already coming down to these lows right here. So, what I'll probably want
0:32
price to do is to take out these lows and then get a pretty big swing up, but
0:38
still to remain bearish because of this high time frame SMT. And
0:44
if this high time frame SMT holds, then that would mean that we're looking to target like these lows and these lows.
0:51
That's going to be more of a weekly outlook again from these highs up to these highs. Again, I'll probably be
0:57
looking for these lows, these lows, and these lows down here.
1:03
Like all of this is low resistance draws and liquidity over here. So, that's what
1:08
I would be looking for on the high time frame on like the weekly
1:14
um in terms of like weekly bias. Like I said last week, I can't remember if I
1:21
did this on a coaching call or not, but like I said last week, we made three
1:26
super bearish days similar to regular ass price action because price is fractal and moves the same way that it
1:32
does on every single time frame. I'm not surprised that we've made these retracements up, but I do think that
1:37
this week will continue bearish um and end up going down. And I think that we're going to start whatever
1:44
kickstarting this little downtrend that has been long overdue. And now we actually have low resistance draws on
1:50
liquidity where we have this draw in liquidity followed by this draw in liquidity.
1:55
So that this FOMC low is no longer super high resistance. I think especially on
2:02
the S&P 500 um you know we can come down and take out this low and then this low
2:10
all at once. So market just opened. We've already completed this low time frame bearish SMT. Obviously the high
2:17
time frame bearish SMT is going to take much longer to play out. Um but I am favoring shorts today.
2:25
We have London session lows right here. 30-minute lows right here. 30-minute lows right here. Asia session lows right
2:31
here. Um we have a decent amount of this leg that we could just completely flood through. Um because all of this is just
2:38
like low resistance draws on liquidity that we could go down and take out. Ideally, what I see would be
2:46
a big five-minute retrace up, either taking out this high or even better on
2:52
NASDAQ would be for us to take out like this pre-market high and then also
2:58
whatever the high time frame high, which would invalidate that high time frame bearish SMT,
3:05
but it would also give us more of a short-term reason to go short, and I'm honestly fine with that.
3:12
So again, on the low time frame, ES is the leading index because it made this lower high. So ES is probably going to
3:18
stay lower, and it's probably going to be the one that we're going to want to be favoring for shorts because it's so close to these lows already. Um, and
3:26
NASDAQ, as we can see, is more so on the bullish side of things. We're already getting a pretty healthy retrace here.
3:32
So yeah, we'll have to see what price wants to do.
4:46
So again, the main objective here would honestly be if like if NASDAQ could come
4:51
up and grab these fiveminute highs or even better come all the way up and take out these highs and then we make like
4:59
another bearish SMT off of that. That would be fire. And then boom, we can just go straight into targeting those
5:05
lows.
6:36
Yeah. SL and ES. Right now, we're staying down. I do think that NASDAQ, I would want for us to come up and take
6:42
out these highs. Keep in mind, guys, I really don't even like fully want to
6:48
necessarily be [ __ ] trading today. Um,
6:54
because I've had such a great month. So, I'm going to be playing defensive.
8:27
So on NASDAQ again, we're just looking for these highs to get taken out for
9:05
Yeah, ES stays low. So, what I'm thinking will probably happen is NASDAQ will rip up, take out this high, maybe
9:12
this high, maybe even this high, and that will cause ES to come up and fill this gap
9:18
and then give us the short entries that we want.
9:31
making that one minute bullish SMT. So that should cause that movement up.
11:50
Cool. Wow. Okay,
11:57
that kind of [ __ ] blows that ES went down and grabbed these lows. This could actually end up turning into a bullish
12:02
scenario because ES is taking out these lows. Is
12:08
that London lows? Yeah. Okay. [ __ ] So ES just came down and took out London
12:15
session lows.
12:22
Well, NASDAQ is staying far above them.
12:27
We'll kind of just have to sit and see what type of situation price presents presents for us.
13:19
Yeah. So ES is under these London lows now
13:24
while NASDAQ is just floating up here. We're kind of in this one minute range right now while ES just like continues
13:32
to move down. Yeah.
14:01
Low key though, like this high time frame SMT is still making me want to be short.
14:12
I mean, the low time frame SMT already played out. That's the problem.
14:17
That's the problem that I'm having right now with price. I would want NASDAQ to take out these highs for sure. If we can
14:23
get above these highs, that's a different story. But it's kind of getting towards I mean, we have like
14:29
8 minutes until 950 hits. the macro hits. So, it's kind of getting to game time right now.
14:44
Okay, cool. So, NASDAQ grabbed these highs.
14:56
We are making like an OD SMT from these lows up to these lows.
15:02
Okay. So, look, this would be fire. So, this would maintain my bullish bias if NASDAQ goes up. Yes. Boom. Awesome.
15:10
Okay. So, we took out that those high time frame highs and we took out these pre-market highs. This is now setting up
15:16
for a really good bearish SMT from these highs down to whatever highs ES makes. I
15:21
want ES to come up and fill this fiveminute gap for surely. I I want that. NASDAQ, I want to see at least
15:29
have it start rotating down from here because we took out these high time frame highs, pre-market highs. Awesome.
15:34
We're gearing up for a really awesome bearish SMT for us to be able to target all of these lows all the way down here.
15:41
ES I want it to move higher. Um,
15:47
it's a really long wick that ends up closing pretty much like a flat dogee
15:52
candle. I want price to move Whoa. I want price to move higher.
16:06
I really want ES to fill this fiveminute gap cuz on NASDAQ there's a whole bunch of manipulation to the upside. on ES.
16:13
There's like little to none right now.
17:08
Go go go go go go go go go go
17:14
go go.
17:20
Nice. Holy [ __ ] has actually ripping. [Music]
17:30
Yeah, there's really nothing left on the I mean there's not much on the left hand side of things
17:36
besides this high, this high, this high, this high, this high on NASDAQ. Like all of this is low resistance draws on
17:42
liquidity, but I don't really think that NASDAQ is going to be willing to go all the way up and start grabbing those.
17:50
I'll put this on just in case so we can keep track of where that high is in relation to NASDAQ's price. But
17:57
this is awesome. Let's have ES fill in that gap now.
18:47
Again,
19:12
I'm more so on the bearish side of things. Especially
19:18
with how low ES is compared to NASDAQ. It's like dog
19:24
couldn't be a more obvious SMT.
19:31
I need ES to get above these highs. Not that I need it, but I really [ __ ]
19:37
want it.
19:44
What I'll want to be doing is keeping my eye out on NASDAQ.
19:50
Watch for like this one minute break of structure.
19:56
Even if we break structure here, I do think that ES bro ES has to
20:02
I want to say that it has to take these guys out.
20:16
There we go. Come on, dude. Go.
20:26
Come on, man.
20:46
Come on, man. Please, please take those out.
21:02
It's 9:49 right now.
21:22
NASDAQ keeps pushing higher. These are those fiveminute highs that starts off that those low resistance draws on
21:27
liquidity. But this is just such an egregious bearish SMT right now.
21:33
I really want ES to come up and take out these highs. I'll be so much like I'll
21:38
feel so much safer if ES can come up and fill this fivem minutee gap, bro.
21:49
Bro, NASDAQ's so close to these highs, too.
21:59
Got to grab them.
22:35
Come on, dude.
22:56
in my opinion. NASDAQ won't get this close to these highs without taking them out.
23:20
Bro,
23:26
I really don't want to go short if we break here on ES, bro.
23:47
Yes, broke structure here, but
23:56
I don't like it enough to go short right now.
24:08
Even if this causes me to stay out of today. Oh.
24:33
Let's see what price does here. I'm kind of interested cuz it's only 952.
24:43
I still think that yes, I honestly with the timing that with what time it is now
24:50
after seeing that break like this could honestly turn into a bullish
24:56
move.
25:14
We need NASDAQ to come up and take out these highs and then we need to see the
25:19
action that follows that.
25:28
So, right now it's like this is either an egregious bearish SMT or we have this
25:34
bullish SMT from London lows down to ES London lows and London highs up or
25:41
sorry, London lows up to NASDAQ London lows.
25:49
So, NASDAQ took out these highs here. Let's go ahead and mark more of them off.
26:23
[Music]
26:29
So tough, bro. This [ __ ] could literally This [ __ ] could go literally either way.
27:11
Okay. If NASDAQ inverses this gap, I will feel safe shorting ES
27:33
or even if just ES inverses this gap.
27:45
Wow, we're still in it. I Okay, I think we still go short here.
27:53
Go ahead and go short.
28:18
Trying to think where I should put this.
28:26
Stop at
28:33
all the way up here.
29:11
Wait, what the [ __ ]
29:17
Wait, what?
29:26
Bro,
30:19
I don't know why they must have changed the lot sizes on my broker. I'm only I'm
30:26
not Let me see something really quick. I'm only
30:34
Let's see what's going on here. Okay, so that's the normal one.
30:41
Okay. Well,
30:57
originally I was only in this [ __ ] for like
31:04
I was only risking like 500 bucks because I guess
31:12
this like I guess they changed what the
31:17
[ __ ] was. I guess the regular [ __ ] is now just like a mini contract instead to
31:23
give people whatever with lower capital and opportunity to do this [ __ ] But okay.
31:48
I'm actually kind of I probably should have waited for this [ __ ] to get
31:53
punched through because I kind of feel like it's going
31:59
to happen.
32:05
But we'll see. Yeah, I don't like the way that that
32:10
NASDAQ's looking.
32:29
So, we came up into this gap now. NASDAQ. We got one more punch up.
32:37
See, now this could kickstart it.
37:15
I think what I'm going to do is literally just mark out
37:23
all of these lows and just keep shedding profit if we do end up going all the way
37:29
down there.
38:48
Let's see here. I move my stop loss above these highs.
38:53
If I lose, I'll probably only end up losing like three grand or maybe probably a little bit more like five
38:59
grand.
39:45
Let's see. Okay, I just got stopped out of my positions. I probably lost like
39:51
seven grand. Yeah, not bad. I lost um $7,93480.
40:02
Um, I kind of want to see where price wants to go from here.
40:10
Probably won't take a take a trade, but we'll see.
40:58
Big rip.
41:10
Yeah, honestly, I think I'm cool with being done for the day. only lost seven grand. So, I'm not like
41:21
um not like too pressed on
41:29
taking another trade today. Didn't really lose much and there's just no reason to go get back into the market.
41:37
So, yeah, I think that's going to wrap it up for me today. $7,000 loss. finally
41:42
broke that six trade win streak that I was on. But hey, man, a loss has to come
41:47
eventually. And I'm glad that it was $7,000 and not [ __ ] like a million.
41:56
Hello.
42:01
Yeah, you can let him in. Thanks. Bye.
42:08
Anyways, um yeah. I'm thinking
42:15
that we'll probably call it a day here. Even though this will probably end up going down.
42:23
Even though this will probably end up going down.
42:57
Bro, do I actually do Yeah.
43:24
Yeah.
43:49
Yeah.
44:00
Sorry, guys. I had to do it, man. I had to do it.
44:06
I wanted it. I had to do it, dudes. I had to
44:12
I had to
44:20
I had to do it. I was just itching, man.
44:26
Just [ __ ] itching, dude. Like you just know when you know where price is going to go and you just can't help but
44:33
not [ __ ] take it. Dude,
44:38
you just can't help but say no to a takerit being hit on that day. You guys
44:46
know that feeling where you're just like, "Fuck, I know where it's going to go, so why
44:52
the [ __ ] would I settle for a loss, right? Doesn't make any [ __ ] sense. doesn't make any sense at all. Why the
44:59
[ __ ] would I settle for a loss when I know that I can just make all the money back and then make money today? Why
45:05
would I do that? Why the freak would I do that?
45:46
Wait. What?
47:17
Okay, bro.
47:30
It was probably lowkey stupid of me to enter right here because now I'm I know price is just going to move slow and I'm
47:35
going to be bored for the next 30 minutes. But we'll just see what happens.
48:08
period. Period.
52:16
Okay, take profit one got hit. I'm going to manage half of my position here.
52:25
Um, so that puts me up $2,300
52:31
on the day. Okay. And then I'm just going to move stops to break even.
54:38
Oh, what the [ __ ] Okay. Well, I guess I put my stop losses
54:43
a little bit too clo a little bit too down, but the rest of my trade got
54:48
stopped out at break even. Anyways, I ended up making some money on it getting stopped out at break even. So, made a
54:54
total of $3,5520 today.
54:59
Better better than a loss. Um, but anyways, that's going to wrap it up for me. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace
55:06
out.
