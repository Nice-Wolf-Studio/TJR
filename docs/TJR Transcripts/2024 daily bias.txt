# https://www.youtube.com/watch/Qk-mHUlSJGU

00:00:01.800 well well well we meet
00:00:06.399 again little
00:00:09.360 baby
00:00:17.480 boy
00:00:19.359 yeah that's
00:00:21.199 right that's
00:00:24.039 right all right boys today we're going
00:00:27.039 to be breaking
00:00:28.279 down how we can find daily bias and I've
00:00:31.599 made like several different videos on
00:00:33.360 this and each video is a different way
00:00:36.480 to find daily bias and just like all of
00:00:38.640 my videos this is just brain dump to you
00:00:41.840 guys to help you guys find what works
00:00:45.559 okay so again not every strategy is
00:00:48.239 going to work for everybody if every
00:00:49.760 strategy worked for every single person
00:00:51.399 that everybody would be profitable um
00:00:53.960 and that's just not the case so what I
00:00:55.760 want to do today with you guys um is
00:00:59.280 break down how I've been finding daily
00:01:01.440 bias as of recently um and obviously all
00:01:05.760 of my da daily bias videos in the past
00:01:08.080 was how I was using daily bias to find
00:01:10.520 it at that time and it still [ __ ]
00:01:12.759 works if you guys use it and it works
00:01:15.159 for you awesome keep using it um but
00:01:18.000 this is just a updated video on how I
00:01:20.200 find my daily bias it's relatively
00:01:22.119 simple and it's using premium and
00:01:23.840 discount and a lot of you guys who've
00:01:26.720 been tapping into the kick streams have
00:01:28.200 been asking like hey how are you doing
00:01:29.759 this so I figured why not make a video
00:01:32.079 on this and if you guys aren't tapping
00:01:33.399 into the kick streams tap the [ __ ] in
00:01:34.960 they happen every single morning at 9:00
00:01:36.240 a.m. eastern time I know I took a little
00:01:37.680 break last week from it but we're back
00:01:40.680 in business streaming every single day
00:01:42.600 for you guys cuz um at this point in
00:01:45.000 time I'm probably back in Puerto Rico
00:01:48.159 for you guys so with that being said get
00:01:52.680 started
00:01:55.560 start all righty
00:01:58.280 so let's get it start started so let's
00:02:02.640 just jump right into this so first thing
00:02:06.960 that I want to explain is how I use
00:02:08.560 premium and discount to help find daily
00:02:10.840 bias you know most of the time I kind of
00:02:12.360 sit here and give you guys a little
00:02:13.599 explanation before we actually go into
00:02:15.000 the chartwork of it so as of recent
00:02:18.400 recently what has been helping me A lot
00:02:20.400 has been identifying whether we are in a
00:02:22.680 premium or a discounted price range and
00:02:25.640 if we're in a discounted price range
00:02:27.040 cool I can go along with the current
00:02:29.400 overall daily bias that I have using the
00:02:31.840 previous daily bias strategy that I had
00:02:34.200 um and if you guys don't know that watch
00:02:35.920 the tradeing transformation I'll leave
00:02:37.319 leave a little Link in the description
00:02:38.840 for you guys to watch that um
00:02:42.519 but I pretty much determin hey if we're
00:02:45.879 in a premium then I'll flip my daily
00:02:48.800 bias and pretty much make the overall
00:02:51.319 Target the equilibrium level so if you
00:02:54.760 guys don't know how to find equilibrium
00:02:56.800 watch the boot camp videos on that and
00:02:58.319 watch the trading transformation videos
00:02:59.640 on on that those playlists are like my
00:03:02.840 Staples
00:03:04.799 for like these upcoming videos that I'm
00:03:08.000 giving to you guys I kind of want to put
00:03:09.360 a name on this little thing like sniper
00:03:12.319 series or something stupid um but
00:03:16.319 whatever these are just overall
00:03:17.760 informative videos where I'm kind of
00:03:19.519 grabbing Concepts um from the trading
00:03:21.840 transformation and the boot camp and
00:03:23.480 combining them together and making just
00:03:26.440 overall videos on how you guys can start
00:03:28.200 putting some of these confluences get
00:03:29.840 together but if you guys want just like
00:03:31.200 the Bare Bones watch those first um and
00:03:34.159 then we can get into it so with that
00:03:36.640 being said we already know equilibrium
00:03:38.200 right when we're in an uptrend we draw
00:03:39.680 it from the lows up to the highs right
00:03:41.760 so let's
00:03:42.920 say this is a
00:03:45.400 low and this is the high okay we want
00:03:48.480 price to come down to this line because
00:03:51.159 this is this is the equilibrium level
00:03:53.079 everything Above This level is a premium
00:03:55.680 and everything below this level is a
00:03:57.280 discount so with that in mind let's say
00:04:00.360 we're in a current uptrend right as you
00:04:02.239 guys know my previous finding daily
00:04:04.599 buyas strategy was like if we're in an
00:04:06.120 uptrend on the 4 Hour and then like the
00:04:07.879 1 hour we're looking for buys only but
00:04:09.680 that has slightly changed because it's
00:04:11.680 limited the amount of Trades that I've
00:04:13.040 been able to take and this has helped me
00:04:15.319 extend that so I'm actually able to take
00:04:17.199 trades whether we're in an uptrend or a
00:04:19.519 downtrend um in in the opposite
00:04:22.240 direction so let's say we're in an
00:04:23.479 uptrend on the 4 Hour but price is
00:04:26.800 within a premium or is within a premium
00:04:30.479 right we want to see price push down
00:04:33.800 into a discounted price range before
00:04:35.600 price can actually keep going higher and
00:04:37.720 higher okay so let's say this is Market
00:04:40.680 open right here and we're in a premium
00:04:43.520 price range I'm going to want to see
00:04:45.880 price go lower down to towards that
00:04:48.160 discounted price range on the high time
00:04:50.600 frame for us to be able to continue that
00:04:53.120 uptrend now let's take this back a
00:04:55.400 little bit more let's say price is right
00:04:58.160 here and this is Market open cool we're
00:05:00.919 still in an uptrend and I'm seeing that
00:05:03.919 hey we're at a discounted price level so
00:05:07.360 more often than not we're in an uptrend
00:05:09.680 and we're at a discounted price level so
00:05:11.520 I want to see price move higher and
00:05:13.360 that's really the only thing that I've
00:05:15.320 added to me finding daily bias as of
00:05:17.680 recently and it's been helping a lot
00:05:21.000 okay so let's go ahead and find an
00:05:23.840 example of this this is a perfect
00:05:25.319 example right here okay and we went over
00:05:27.600 this in this the past week's um Market
00:05:30.400 recap Market recap
00:05:32.360 so this was uh July
00:05:36.440 2024 July 1st okay stupid July 1st we
00:05:41.560 see a break of structure to the upside
00:05:44.199 on the 4our time frame okay let's go in
00:05:47.560 here and Mark out Market open really
00:05:50.600 quick come on bro my computer's been
00:05:53.720 lagging a bit recently and that's not
00:05:55.520 very typical of this computer out here
00:05:58.440 in Miami it's usually pretty
00:06:01.080 solid okay so you're probably saying hey
00:06:04.639 we broke structure back to the upside or
00:06:06.560 back to the downside on this candle that
00:06:08.160 is true however after that we got
00:06:11.599 another breakup structure back to the
00:06:12.960 upside okay so first of all let's just
00:06:16.120 say we're looking just at this right we
00:06:17.880 see that we broke structure to the
00:06:19.680 upside we're in an
00:06:21.840 uptrend what are we looking
00:06:24.000 for equilibrium to get hit what happens
00:06:27.759 equilibrium gets hit price up moving
00:06:30.000 higher on top of that how can we even
00:06:32.919 more so use this to our advantage we can
00:06:35.840 look at this
00:06:37.039 range so overall on the super high time
00:06:40.199 frame what are we in we're in an
00:06:43.599 uptrend okay we can
00:06:47.000 identify these as range lows and these
00:06:49.360 as range highs right this is a pretty
00:06:51.319 significant low this is a pretty
00:06:52.599 significant High we end up breaking 4our
00:06:54.319 structure to the downside so we're we
00:06:55.879 can kind of assume hey this is probably
00:06:57.319 a daily retrace so with that in mind
00:07:00.680 what can we do we can take this from
00:07:03.599 these range lows up to these range highs
00:07:05.479 and we can see
00:07:07.039 okay price made a low we made a high we
00:07:10.720 push into equilibrium perfect I can look
00:07:14.319 for I like my overall daily bias is
00:07:17.039 going to be long because we push into
00:07:19.039 equilibrium on daily time frame off of a
00:07:21.599 daily retrace and then on top of
00:07:24.000 that we get a 4-Hour breaking structure
00:07:26.199 to the
00:07:27.120 upside now if we want to scale we can
00:07:30.120 now say like these hourly range lows up
00:07:32.919 to these hourly range highs after the
00:07:34.720 hourly breaking structure back to the
00:07:36.120 downside because now this is probably
00:07:37.400 going to be a 4-Hour
00:07:40.240 retrace we retrace down into equilibrium
00:07:43.520 so what can we be looking for for this
00:07:45.240 day longs price goes
00:07:50.440 higher okay let's show another example
00:07:54.000 of
00:07:57.879 this let's show an example
00:08:01.400 where price has already made an
00:08:03.639 extension and we're looking for a
00:08:07.080 retrace let's see if we have one here no
00:08:10.039 this is after we already got a break
00:08:12.639 there was some pretty decent ones down
00:08:14.639 over here
00:08:18.080 um do I remember
00:08:21.879 this oh this one's a good one I
00:08:25.360 believe yeah this one's an awesome one
00:08:28.400 okay here we go [ __ ] if I can remember
00:08:31.159 when that was right here I think
00:08:33.839 yeah I caught a fire ass trade off of
00:08:37.839 this where was Market
00:08:40.719 open Okay so let's bring this back to
00:08:44.080 the 4
00:08:49.320 Hour okay so if we want to get like
00:08:51.880 extremely analytical with the shits you
00:08:54.440 know we could say like oh like try and
00:08:56.720 identify the overall range lows or range
00:08:58.640 Highs but for the most part I'm never
00:09:00.680 really looking at the daily time frame
00:09:02.519 I'm mainly just trying to look at the 4H
00:09:04.640 hour time frame because that's really as
00:09:06.640 high as I want to go in terms of trying
00:09:08.200 to find overall daily buyas so this is a
00:09:10.240 perfect example of us being bullish for
00:09:14.800 the day but I ended ended up taking a
00:09:17.399 bearish trade okay so we can see here
00:09:19.839 that we break 4our
00:09:21.720 structure on this most recent candle
00:09:24.880 right on this most recent 4-Hour
00:09:27.680 candle what we haven't done though is
00:09:31.240 we've made the extension so this is
00:09:33.360 another thing I want to
00:09:35.480 mention right so let's say we're in an
00:09:38.600 uptrend every single leg up is an
00:09:41.680 extension when I see an extension up we
00:09:45.040 pretty much always have to assume that
00:09:46.880 we are going to be due for a retrace
00:09:48.920 down to fill
00:09:52.560 equilibrium almost always price will
00:09:54.800 always be trying to seek out an
00:09:56.720 equilibrium level before moving up and
00:09:58.760 higher
00:10:00.200 okay almost always so with that in mind
00:10:03.880 right if we are moving like this and we
00:10:06.320 see boom extension and we're at the top
00:10:08.399 of an extension and we start seeing
00:10:11.440 bearish signs on Lower time frames that
00:10:13.640 price is going to start moving lower
00:10:15.519 where can we safely assume that price is
00:10:17.800 going to want to go towards equilibrium
00:10:20.760 and that's how we can help find a
00:10:22.160 bearish daily bias within
00:10:25.279 bullish Market structure
00:10:29.600 so this is a perfect example we're in
00:10:32.120 bullish Market structure but look at
00:10:34.040 this we made an extension on top of that
00:10:37.839 if we scale
00:10:40.760 in we see oh price swept out these highs
00:10:45.720 right here that's like boom bare [ __ ]
00:10:48.240 foundations of the tjr strategy we see
00:10:51.560 price sweep liquidity so what can we be
00:10:54.560 looking for price to hit equilibrium
00:10:57.760 okay so we take it from these range lows
00:11:00.000 up to these hourly range highs right how
00:11:02.680 do we know it's the hourly range highs
00:11:04.040 because we start breaking structure to
00:11:05.160 the downside and look how it perfectly
00:11:07.480 fills equilibrium okay and then on top
00:11:09.760 of that we also have this big ass
00:11:11.839 imbalance okay and that can be that can
00:11:14.079 be used in our favor to say hey
00:11:17.360 imbalanced price action needs to be
00:11:19.200 balanced out so we see boom from these
00:11:21.760 range lows up to these range highs cool
00:11:24.279 how can we scale down more
00:11:27.200 so let's get down and dir
00:11:32.639 okay we see boom sweep of liquidity
00:11:36.519 right when Market
00:11:38.399 opens okay from there let's see if we
00:11:41.279 can see anything boom we get a break of
00:11:43.120 structure to the downside on the 15
00:11:44.560 minute right here awesome and scale down
00:11:47.639 even lower I don't know if the 5 minute
00:11:49.519 or the one minute will let me get all
00:11:50.839 the way over
00:11:52.279 here five minute I think it will cool I
00:11:55.959 don't think the one minute will let me
00:11:57.480 go all the way over there
00:12:04.200 okay we get a break of structure on the
00:12:05.680 15 minute okay we come up we fill in
00:12:08.160 this
00:12:12.279 imbalance guarantee you there is some
00:12:14.720 sort of 1 hour confluences or sorry one
00:12:18.040 minute confluences within here to give
00:12:20.760 us that overall bias for price to end up
00:12:23.279 wanting to seek out equilibrium so
00:12:25.480 that's a perfect example of when we are
00:12:27.160 in an uptrend we've already already made
00:12:29.600 the extension but we haven't made the
00:12:31.079 retracement and how do we know that
00:12:32.480 there's going to be a retracement when
00:12:34.079 we start seeing confluences like this
00:12:35.760 when we see a sweep of liquidity when we
00:12:37.279 see like 15minute break of structure and
00:12:39.279 again this is just using my strategy
00:12:42.040 what do we know about price price is
00:12:43.959 fractal okay so we know that we can use
00:12:48.360 these confluences on really any time
00:12:49.959 frame right if we're within a daily
00:12:52.600 extension and we start seeing 4H hour
00:12:54.920 capitulation to the
00:12:57.199 downside and we're in an uptrend
00:13:00.040 on The Daily we can safely assume that
00:13:02.959 the 4-Hour capitulation is going to go
00:13:04.760 towards daily equilibrium it's the same
00:13:06.760 thing that we did here the 4our is in an
00:13:09.720 uptrend we see 1 hour sweep and we start
00:13:12.560 to see 1 hour capitulation what can we
00:13:14.880 safely assume about what's going to
00:13:16.880 happen 4H hour equilibrium is going to
00:13:18.600 be hit okay and then we can even do this
00:13:21.800 more so to the very next one okay
00:13:25.279 so let's go back to wherever we were
00:13:30.160 right
00:13:32.800 here okay so boom this was this day and
00:13:35.920 then moving forward boom this is the
00:13:38.279 next day oh bro the these past those
00:13:41.440 past two trading days were [ __ ]
00:13:42.800 beautiful for this and I'm glad I
00:13:45.360 remembered
00:13:48.519 this we'll just slap that
00:13:51.680 on another example
00:13:54.079 here extension we see bearish attributes
00:13:58.600 on the L where do we want price to go
00:14:01.120 4our equilibrium now if we go back to
00:14:04.399 the 4 Hour sorry I'm jumping all around
00:14:07.199 if we go back to the 4 Hour we're still
00:14:09.800 in bullish Market structure we haven't
00:14:11.120 broken 4 Hour structure to the downside
00:14:13.560 what do we see okay we see 4 Hour
00:14:15.279 extension up and then we start seeing
00:14:16.839 price go down this is during pre-market
00:14:19.279 so what can we do find 4-Hour equilibri
00:14:21.560 equilibrium 4-Hour equilibrium is
00:14:23.800 already hit during
00:14:25.480 pre-market we go into the
00:14:27.759 hourly we you can see oh
00:14:30.279 wow equili theum was already hit so
00:14:33.079 we're in an uptrend we're in a
00:14:34.560 discounted price range what does that
00:14:36.160 give us the opportunity to do look for
00:14:39.120 Longs craziness okay so from there we
00:14:42.240 can scale into the 15 minute I I don't
00:14:43.959 necessarily need to go through like
00:14:45.399 fullon execution
00:14:52.600 but okay we get into the discounted
00:14:55.120 price range we see price boom rip down
00:14:59.040 we end up getting I'm pretty sure there
00:15:00.560 was smt Divergence off of these lows

00:16:40.440 explains how I use premium in discount
00:16:42.680 with my current daily bias strategy just
00:16:45.160 using the 4our and 1 hour Trends to help
00:16:48.279 identify when we're in an uptrend on the
00:16:50.959 4 Hour but we can still technically look
00:16:53.199 for shorts when we're within a premium
00:16:55.399 price range and then if we're in a
00:16:57.800 discounted price range we're still going
00:16:59.240 to be looking for Longs cool cool
