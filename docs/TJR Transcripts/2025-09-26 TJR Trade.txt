Top of the morning, guys. Uh market opened and it's [ __ ] the bed right now. And that was my bias for the day. I
0:09
didn't think that it was going to happen this quick, but it did. Um
0:14
let me go ahead and put on previous day highs. So, we were in just an SMT divergence
0:23
whirlwind prior to market open. So, this is something that I want to show you guys so you guys can kind of like
0:29
understand um when SMTs have been completed and when we can kind of start
0:36
to disregard them. So, right here we have a high and then a higher high on
0:41
ES. On NASDAQ, we have a high then a lower high. This is an SMT divergence.
0:47
The SMT divergence is completed when the leading index goes down to take out
0:52
whatever the most recent high time frame low is. is that ideally is connected to the high time frame high. So this right
0:59
here is the high time frame low that is connected or whatever like leads up to
1:04
the high time frame high that starts the SMT divergence. So this SMT divergence
1:10
gets completed when we take out these lows. Awesome. So I'm not saying that there's no that there isn't any more
1:16
downside for this SMT divergence. I'm just saying that this is a very good take-profit point and I would highly
1:21
recommend you guys aren't necessarily looking to take shorts following the SMT
1:28
divergence being completed because it's it's a point of reversal. And then as we can see here, we get another SMT
1:35
divergence. We have Asia session low followed by London session low. We have a low then a lower low and then on the
1:41
uh S&P 500 we have a low. Notice how the lagging index doesn't necessarily have to come down and complete the SMT. Okay,
1:49
so again, SMT diver, bearish SMT divergence. NASDAQ completed it. Now we have a bullish SMT divergence. So from
1:55
this low up to this low. Now, same situation. We want to look at the
2:01
leading index and we want to see the high that is attached to the low that is
2:06
making the SMT. So in this case, it's this high right here, this London session high. And then as we can see
2:12
this SMT divergence gets completed. Um and then on NASDAQ it got completed as well which is awesome. Um so now you're
2:20
pro like and this the reason why I wanted to bring this up is because a lot of you guys are like well we have a high
2:26
time frame SMT divergence. Yes we did have a high time frame SMT divergence right here but it's already been
2:33
completed because we took out these highs. So, I'm not necessarily only
2:39
going to be looking for longs here because whatever there was this pre-market SMT divergence. Not saying that I can't be long, but I'm just
2:46
saying that this SMT divergence has already been completed. So, we can or at least I will no longer be using it as a
2:53
confluence um for looking for longs. Now that that's out the way, we can look at
2:58
current price action. So, we have previous day highs right here. We initially made a pretty quick move down
3:05
and now we're getting uh flipping back to the upside here.
3:11
I would like to to believe that we're going to go
3:17
lower here. So,
3:23
I'm good at this trading [ __ ] Yesterday, I was pretty much able to Oh,
3:30
[ __ ] You guys didn't see that trade recap because I didn't end up taking a trade, so I didn't end up even posting
3:35
it. Ah, [ __ ] Well, okay. Um, yesterday I was a That [ __ ] sucks because it
3:42
was really good analysis. Um, I can post both if you guys want, but it doesn't really matter. All that it matters is I
3:50
know exactly what I did. Um, and I called it out to an absolute T. I said that I don't think that whatever we were
3:57
moving down very very smoothly, right? And I was saying I don't think that we're going to come any further down
4:03
than there was some fiveminute lows within here that ES had taken out and we were actually making a bullish S&
4:09
divergence. These are the five-minute lows that we made the bullish SMT divergence on uh with NASDAQ. So NASDAQ
4:15
made a higher low uh or yeah a higher low while ES ended up going underneath them. I I can't remember where they
4:20
were. They were like somewhere over here but we ended up making a lower low on ES.
4:25
Cool. So, what was I saying? So, I I predicted
4:32
that I saw that we were going to make a bullish SMT divergence off of that. And I also said I don't think that we're going to come all the way down and take
4:39
out these FOMC lows all the way down here because we off of the chairman of the Fed pretty
4:47
much giving us pretty bearish news. Um, when was this? on Tuesday during his
4:55
speech. Um, and that kind of caused this capitul capitulation to take out low
5:00
resistance liquidity, low resistance, liquidity, low resistance, liquidity, low resistance, liquidity, and then all of the 5minute low resistance draws on
5:06
liquidity all the way until this is the last remaining low possible for us to
5:12
take out. And at this point in time, this is high resistance liquidity that caused this big move up. So, I was
5:17
saying, look, we already sold off super heavily during pre-market. I think that we're going to get a retrace and I think
5:23
that we need a retrace that is going to move up pretty substantially to make a
5:28
high time frame retrace because I I do expect us to eventually go down and take
5:33
out these lows. But I don't think after taking out all of these low resistance draws and liquidity that we're just
5:39
going to go down and want to take out this high resistance draw and liquidity that started this big up move in the
5:45
first place. That ended up being correct. I wasn't able to find entries for longs. I wanted a 5minute SMT
5:50
divergence. I didn't have it. Both of the indexes ended up moving uh up without me. Overall, my bias was
5:57
correct. I just couldn't find it an entry yesterday. Now, we're in this position where on
6:04
NASDAQ, we have a decent amount of low resistance draws and liquidity that also lead us to potentially come down to FOMC
6:11
lows here. Um, and ES is still like we're kind we kind of have stacked up
6:17
low resistance draws on liquidity here as well on ES. Not really so much. Um, but still pretty decent low resistance
6:24
draws and liquidity. I would like to be bearish today. Um,
6:31
because overall we've made this retrace that I wanted to happen that I wanted to
6:36
happen happen on the high time frames. Um, and on top of that, I just don't I see
6:44
these indexes going lower overall. We
6:50
did have three backto backto back super bearish days on these indexes. And I do
6:55
think that we are due for a daily retrace just for the next week to open up and then go down even further. I
7:02
think high time frames, this is something that I mentioned in yesterday's trade recap that didn't get posted because I didn't end up taking a
7:08
trade. But high time frames in terms of where I would like to see price go first
7:14
of all, crypto's [ __ ] the bed. I talked about that in yesterday. I think I should post yesterday's trade recap.
7:19
So, I'll post this video. Um, and then I'll attach yesterday's trade recap to the end of this uh video as well. It's
7:26
going to be a long trade recap, but if you guys want that extra information, by all means. Um, but I'll briefly cover
7:31
what I talked about on the high time frames. Um, essentially we're super overextended. Chairman of the Fed said
7:36
equity prices are a little bit higher than they should be. That caused the initial sell-off that we seen over the
7:42
past 3 days. And I think that we can go a lot lower. I think that over the next whatever 2 to 3 months at least on
7:47
equities, we should be able to come down and take out these relative equal lows. these lows right here, we've essentially
7:53
generated a whole bunch of low resistance draws and liquidity um throughout th this entire move up. And I
8:01
think that we have a bunch of really good draws on liquidity that pretty much align with previous high time frame
8:08
all-time highs or previous all-time highs. And the same thing goes for the S&P 500. I think that we can, you know,
8:14
come down relative equal lows come down relative equal or low resistance draws and liquidity stacked up all through
8:21
here. And then again, these draws and liquidity line up perfectly for a high time frame retest of previous all-time
8:26
highs. Um, and then boom, like this, in my opinion, I'm not a financial adviser,
8:31
but uh I think that stocks obviously if the indexes are selling off, then stocks are going to sell off. Stocks have just
8:37
been on an absolute tear right now. Um, and we're slowly starting to see a bit
8:44
of a sell-off. We're crypto's been leading the market with that. We've been seeing a sell-off on crypto. I would like to see uh Bitcoin get back
8:51
underneath $100,000. And I'll be max bidding anywhere from like 95,000 to 90,000. I think that's
8:59
super probable for Bitcoin. And I don't think that we're going to be in these four year cycles anymore. I think with
9:06
the ETF flows of Bitcoin, it's going to make it a lot more stable. Um, and it's
9:12
going to move a little bit different than it has in the past where I don't think we're going
9:17
to get these super drastic. I think this was is a good indication of what we can
9:23
kind of expect for future bare markets of crypto where we went sideways for how
9:28
long was this from March, March, April, May, June, July, August,
9:36
September, and October until we went back up again. So that's around like 5 to 6 months of
9:43
sideways/down movement. I think that is what we can expect instead of these very drastic move down moves down because of
9:49
the inst in institutional flows that are now coming into the crypto market. Um, altcoins are just a [ __ ] mess. Um, I
9:55
think we have to be way more strategic when it comes to bidding on altcoins. I got absolutely burned this cycle trying
10:02
to just do the buy and hold method and I think every single other person got burned doing that buy and hold method.
10:08
There is no there's no longer like the alt season that you guys are seeking out when it comes to crypto is no longer a
10:13
thing. Um alt season has been going on consistently for this pretty much this
10:19
entire run, but it's just been driven by different narratives. Okay. And right now we're seeing a really awesome
10:24
bearish SMT from these highs down to these highs. Um again kind of reinforcing that bearish bias that we
10:30
were talking about um that I wanted to see for NASDAQ. Especially because NASDAQ's
10:36
the leading index here. we can start whatever going down and looking for these lows to end up getting getting taken out. But anyways, all season
10:44
there's no s there's there's not going to be an alt season anymore. Okay, there the the market there's thousands
10:51
hundreds of thousands of coins that are created on a daily basis. There's a new narrative popping up every other week.
10:58
Um, and you you really have to be like chronically online and chronically in
11:03
the crypto trenches to be able to spot these narratives and to be able to get in there early and to be able to take advantage of them. Me personally, I'm no
11:10
longer as deep in the crypto trenches as I was previously in previous runs. Um,
11:17
and because of that, I'm just going to be sticking to the majors. So, that's going to be Bitcoin. Um, I honestly am
11:24
going to I this is just my opinion. I think um I'd rather stay away from
11:30
Ethereum and I'll I'll be prioritizing Salana. Um and then these two coins as
11:35
well, Hyperlid and Pump Fun. Um those are really like the the main the main
11:42
coins that I'm looking at. Hyperlid is uh super or again I'm not a financial
11:48
adviser, but a pretty obvious play for me. I think that we do need to get to
11:53
around $30. Again, we have all of this low resistance draws in liquidity and I
11:58
think that Bitcoin hasn't nearly moved down or hasn't moved down nearly as much as it needs to um yet. Same thing with
12:05
Ethereum, you know. I think that we can get down to whatever 2,500
12:11
around on Ethereum. It would be [ __ ] crazy if we could get down to uh sub
12:17
like 1.3K on ETH. That would be like super drastic. And then when it comes to
12:22
Salana, I mean, dude, I would love to see it get under a hundred bucks, again, that's
12:27
kind of drastic, but anything at at this level for real, like 125 bucks, I think that's a bid in my opinion. Um, so
12:34
that's just like a little high time frame analysis for you guys. Now, let's um so we didn't end up forming that SMT
12:42
divergence just yet, which is actually better for us.
12:51
because ideally we wait a little bit later in the trading day to be able to get that.
12:59
So if this closes bearish, I would I would I want ES to close bearish as well.
13:06
We're well above those highs on ES. But I mean regardless, it doesn't really
13:11
matter. The next fiveminute candle could give us the bearish close that we want.
13:16
Okay, nice flip bearish. 30 seconds.
13:24
30 seconds to flip bearish.
13:31
So, yeah, right now I see downside potential for
13:37
the indexes. Obviously, I'm going to be favoring NASDAQ. NASDAQ has the better draws in liquidity anyways because we
13:42
have this low right here, this low right here, this low right here. Whereas ES, this low ended up taking out this low.
13:48
So, this is technically like high resistance liquidity. ES has these two, these three lows stacked up. So, this is
13:54
decent low resistance draws and liquidity for the S&P 500. Um, but NASDAQ has these has much better, much
14:02
higher time frame um longer and deeper draws in liquidity all the way down
14:07
here. uh that I think is just really good to or really obvious for us to be
14:14
able to target. Um obviously price is going down pretty quickly right now. I'm not too concerned
14:20
about that. Um we as long as we can make a high here on ES then I think we're
14:26
going to be sitting pretty or if we can just break one minute structure right here and then from there I am expecting
14:33
at least a 5m minute up candle or some form of 5minute retrace before we can start rumbling down. It's around like
14:40
9:45 right now. Um, so again, I'm going to want to wait a little little bit later in the trading day for me to be
14:46
able to want to go short because these the up
14:52
here again, we have to keep both the indexes in mind. ES just came down and filled this 5-minute gap. So, we're
14:57
going to try and convince these people that, hey, we're actually going to go higher here. Um, and in turn, when when
15:04
we do end up convincing those people, hey, we're going to go higher here and get that whatever five minute up candle,
15:09
whatever it may be. um that's when we're going to be looking to go short because we're convincing everybody, hey, we're
15:16
going to go higher. Um when in fact, in my opinion, I don't think we are. So,
15:23
we shall see. We shall see. But right now, as long as ES can give us
15:31
some sort of uh bearish close on this next fivem minute candle, um that would be awesome. If we
15:39
keep continuing bullish, then we'll just have to sit and wait um for that to happen.
15:46
Yeah, that's what I'm seeing right now.
16:18
We'll put these on for ES just in case. And then
16:28
that would just be even more so reinforcing the downside potential if ES sweeps out
16:34
those hourly highs because NASDAQ is nowhere near close to those highs right now.
16:43
Well, ES could potentially grab these. It actually probably will
16:50
again. So, whatever. NASDAQ probably convinced some
16:55
people that whatever to go short. I wouldn't even mind if uh NASDAQ post its
17:01
head above these highs. I think that would reinforce my bearish bias even more so because we're able to stop out
17:06
more longs.
17:14
Yeah, this is fire. Sitting up good. And it's again it's it's pushing higher as
17:19
we're getting um deeper into the trading day. And that's what I want to see.
19:35
Okay, awesome. So, ES grabbed those 1 hour highs. Now, I would like to see
19:40
price start rotating down.
19:48
And awesome. NASDAQ was able to poke its head above these highs as well.
19:55
So sweet. Yep. This is exactly where we want to be now.
20:00
Exactly where we want to be.
20:17
Beautiful.
20:25
Beautiful. Let's see how this gap holds. Nice. Yeah, dude. This is looking great.
20:35
See how this gap holds on both of these indexes. But again, dude, again, like I said, I would like for NASDAQ to come up
20:42
above these highs. That would be even better to stop out the people that were going short to reinforce that short
20:48
bias. I'm good at this, dude. I'm good at this. I'm good at this.
21:00
Let's see how these gaps hold. It's 952 right now.
21:34
See how this fiveminute candle closes.
21:42
on NASDAQ because we're already like we've already formed or I mean I need ES
21:49
to close bearish like this but that SMT divergence and this fivem minute retrace already on
21:57
NASDAQ kind of puts me in the situation of if we can get this bearish SMT divergence
22:04
I'll immediately just like I was already be just down in the trench on the one
22:12
minute time frame and just be looking for entries.
22:20
So again, we have a minute 30 left to be able to see if we can close bearish up here.
22:28
Something I do want to be conscious of though is that even though we made this
22:35
fivem minute retrace already on NASDAQ, ES hasn't necessarily made another
22:40
fiveminute retrace up, but I think that we should be pretty I think we should be
22:47
okay off of that. I I don't think that we're going to need
22:53
another fiveminute retrace on ES because we already had one on NASDAQ that took
22:59
out these highs here and again got more people to go long.
23:05
That that was the main goal with that. Let's just get people enticed with the long bias.
23:17
So I want to make sure that this closes bearish. We have like bearish SMT of doom right
23:26
now from these highs down to these highs and then also these hourly highs all the way down to these highs as well. So
23:33
these highs up to these highs and then these highs up to these highs. NASDAQ is looking prime time for short work.
23:48
Let's keep our eye on Yes.
23:54
4 seconds. 3 seconds. Cool. We're going to close bearish. Awesome. Okay, cool. So, we got that bearish SMT.
24:06
Now, it's literally going to be as simple as us breaking structure or
24:11
inversing this gap. And then I can go ahead and get down.
24:48
It's looking good.
24:56
Uh, not quite. Didn't get it yet.
25:01
Again,
25:10
I want to be a little bit wary of jumping the gun on this. That's why I want to make sure that we actually break
25:16
structure or inverse this gap here because we do have the potential for ES
25:22
to make a little fivem minute up candle here. I don't necessarily need it to come all the way up and um come back up
25:29
above these highs. So, we already got that. Um, but again, a 5minute retrace
25:34
is something that could happen here on ES. Doesn't really have to in my opinion,
25:41
but it is something that we need to keep in mind because again, this is in bullish order flow right now. So
25:47
regardless, even though we made that bearish SMT, you know, like in order for this to reverse, more often than not, we
25:54
are going to need like a fivem minute retrace and then from there, that's when we can start dumping. Um, so that's
26:01
something that we want to keep in mind.
26:10
And this would this would be even better
26:16
if we come back above these highs one more time and take out these highs right
26:23
here. This would be even better for shorts.
26:32
I think we're going to want to do that.
26:54
Regardless, if if we don't take these out, then it's fine. But it would be it would be pretty nice. It would set us up
27:00
even better. set us up even better for shorts.
27:08
Like that that confluence of us taking out these highs would literally like I would be willing to press short like
27:15
anywhere above these highs with like no other confluences. I would be so willing to do that.
27:36
So, a minute 20 left. Again, we're getting that fivem minutee retrace that again would honestly makes me way more
27:43
comfortable taking a short
28:10
This five-minute candle closes once this candlestick is done.
28:56
It would be so freaking good. Okay, so boom. this 5-minute candle closed. Yes. Awesome. Boom. We got above these highs.
29:03
This is gorgeous. So, now it's just waiting for that
29:08
reversal.
29:46
Like I said, I literally want to go short here. Maybe I go like low risk. Toss a lowrisk
29:54
short on right here. I'm going to do that.
30:05
Yep. Stops above these highs.
30:35
And then let's see.
31:22
See how we start moving here.
31:52
So good. Top t. Top t on my day.
32:13
Top tier on Monday.
32:27
So sexy. So hot. So good. Love it.
32:34
Love it. Love it. Love it.
33:42
So good.
35:17
So good. So freaking good, dude.
35:25
On a lowrisk trade. [ __ ] crushing it, dude.
35:31
Close half my position here. Going to move stop to break even.
36:05
This has been an undefeated week for me.
36:10
Not a single losing trade this week. I forgot to tell you guys, when I closed
36:16
that um initial position, I made $19,245.
36:22
And once we take this out as well,
36:35
I'll be up a little bit more.
36:42
So again, just like with this bearish SMT, I could I very well could have not even
36:48
taken profit here, but I just wanted to cuz I was up so much money. Um, but especially on a lowrisk entry. Like this
36:54
was already a one. Like look at this risk-reward, bro. This is a crazy riskreward trade. Um,
37:03
but yeah, I'm [Music] like this risk-reward is nuts. But I
37:11
very well could have held just all the way down to here because this is the this is the low that's attached to the
37:16
high. Even more so, I can still probably be pretty strong and pretty solid in
37:24
wanting to hold all the way down till like here or even here because this low is attached to this high and this is the
37:31
lag or leading index on this SMT divergence.
37:37
But regardless, I I think that we're going to take out these lows. This was the like the toughest tick
37:44
ever.
39:11
It's kind of unfortunate I didn't go heavier on that risk. I probably I probably could have entered
39:17
with way more risk once we invalidated this gap, but I mean I was already up so much. I mean, even to
39:26
Just this first take profit, it was a one to three risk-to-reward,
39:31
you know.
39:42
This is a what is this? A one to 11 risk reward
39:49
fire.
40:10
Okay, closing some more partials there.
40:15
So now I'm up $33,719.88.
40:23
Stop has already been at break even.
40:46
And let's keep going lower, shall we? Shall we?
41:00
Remember like a week and a half ago when everybody said, "I sucked at trading."
41:07
Yeah. I wonder where those guys are at now. I wonder if if they're, you know,
41:13
willing and able to make a video on this past undefeated week that I've
41:19
had. And literally since since them making those videos, I have made
41:25
$600,000 from them making those videos, I am now
41:32
up $600,000. So, you know, let's just
41:40
like let's just say that those guys were
41:45
pretty wrong, you know, like I I get on here every single day and show you guys like every every single inch and every
41:52
single ounce of proof, you know? Like there's not a single time that I
41:59
don't post my daily PNO, my weekly PNO, and my monthly PNO.
42:06
Even if I don't trade, I'm showing you guys that I didn't trade for that day. And you guys can again add up all the
42:12
numbers every single day. Take [ __ ] screenshots of my Instagram story or just look at back back fact check it
42:18
against these trade recaps. And it's like, bro, I'm doing this every single day and I have been doing this every
42:24
single day for months, for [ __ ] years, bro. And you guys are just still
42:29
like, he doesn't know how to trade, bro. I'm showing like this is this is full live [ __ ] proof in front of your
42:34
[ __ ] face. I don't know how I don't know how much more you guys need, but
42:54
you know, then again, haters going to hate. Haters
42:59
gonna hate on the one to [ __ ] 11 risk-to-reward ratio on your [ __ ]
43:05
head top. Sorry buddy.

43:25
this month is just disrespectful, bro. I'm up $55,000
43:31
this month.
43:40
Just straight disrespectful disrespectful monthly P&L.
43:48
This singular month makes up for the vast majority of my
43:56
trading profits over the past six months. Like just this this month alone
44:03
makes up for like a lot of the money that I've made over the past half a year.
44:28

44:34

44:41

Oh my god. [Music]
50:16
Oh, yeah. Guys, something I um forgot to mention, but I'm doing a 3-day live
50:23
event for you guys. Like a 3-day educational event. So again, if you guys
50:28
are watching these YouTube videos and you guys are like, "Man, I want to learn how to trade like this or at least get
50:34
into this, I'm going to be doing like a full super long, really in-depth 3-day
50:40
live event um teaching you guys how to again take trades just like me um over 3
50:46
days. I'm going to close more of my position here. Um but yeah, it's going to be from November 8th through the
50:53
10th. It's going to be three days straight um of just straight [ __ ]
50:58
gold mine worth of value. Um I'm going to be going over literally every single
51:04
confluence. Um how to build out your strategy, going over psychological tips,
51:10
going over risk management. There will be a portion where you guys will be able to ask me questions on whatever you guys
51:17
have questions on whether it's psychology, risk management, journaling, uh strategy, confluences. It's going to
51:24
be my guess is around 10 hours total over the 3 days. It's going to be crazy.
51:30
Uh the first day is going to be honestly like I think it's going to be around like 5 hours of me just like just
51:36
getting into it. Just pure pure value. like I'm going to stim the [ __ ] out, drink a whole bunch of caffeine and lock
51:43
in for you guys. And we made it over a weekend. So, if you guys are in school and you guys are trying to uh whatever,
51:50
learn trading, but you guys are like, "Oh, damn." Like, whatever. I have school. Don't worry. We positioned it so
51:56
that you guys would be able to uh would be able to take advantage of the
52:01
opportunity. Um so, yeah, if you guys want to sign up to that, I'll leave a link into this in the description. It'll
52:07
just say 3-day live event again. The shit's going to be [ __ ] awesome, bro. I've never done something like this
52:13
before, but it's literally just going to be three whole [ __ ] days of just straight boot camp combine, get to
52:20
[ __ ] work, take notes, um, and just grind towards everybody's grinding
52:26
towards a common goal, and I'm going to be there leading you guys along the way. Um, so yeah, if you guys want to be a
52:31
part of that, I'll leave a little link in the description for you guys to sign up to that. I think it's going to be awesome. I've never done something like
52:38
this before and it's just going to be like great primer for you guys to either one get into trading or two be able to
52:44
cover some of the mistakes or some of the things that you guys may be missing when it comes to your trading. We're also going to have a couple um guest
52:51
speakers come on. So like Umar Ashro is going to be speaking um as you guys know
52:56
he's legendary trader in the space doesn't sell a course um and he's going
53:01
to be giving like a whole bunch of value and details. Um, and it's always nice to
53:06
hear from different traders other than like specifically your mentor because you never know, they could give you some sort of value that you didn't even know
53:13
that you were missing in the first place. So, um, I'm super duper excited for it. You guys should sign up to it.
53:18
Um, and we're going to close more of this position here. So, with both of those position closes, I am now up
53:26
$47,72310 today. We are now up $88,000 on the week
53:34
and a total of $519,000 on the month.
53:39
Um, we do have, you know, these massive lows all the way down here that we could
53:46
end up targeting. I'm personally going to let this thing run. Um, I see no
53:54
reason why not to. My stop loss is all the way the [ __ ] up here.
54:00
To give you guys some context, this already has been a 1 to5.6
54:05
risk-to-reward ratio, which is insane. Um,
54:12
go ahead, set an alert right here. I mean, this
54:18
this price range right here is super unbalanced. We could just flood through this [ __ ] right now.
54:28
Like look, we see swift move down, swift move up, swift move down, swift move up. Super imbalance price.
54:38
I'm thinking I set another takeprofit right here.
54:50
But yeah, bro, today's been a good trading day.
54:57
And I, bro, that's the crazy thing. If I went with my regular risk today, this would be this would I would be up six
55:03
figures right now. But I did half of what I usually do. Bro, I literally I
55:09
only risked like 13 or like $10,000 on this trade. And I'm up 47,000 right now.
55:17
47 racks off of risking like 13 to like $10,000, which is crazy.
55:25
Um, I honestly think that we can flood down here, bro.
55:31
Let's compare it to ES. Like ES will probably want to take out these lows. And if that's the case, then NASDAQ can
55:37
for sure ski run down here. As long as this is just like quick, if it starts slowing down, then whatever. I'll just
55:44
I'll call it. And I'll keep you guys updated on the Instagram stories, but
55:49
I think because this is such an imbalanced price action and price has just been boom flood, boom, flood, boom,
55:56
flood, boom, flood, we should be able to follow the same action
56:02
that happened previously.
56:12
Super good way to end the week. Just an extra 50k to top it off.
56:19
Undefeated week. Absolutely [ __ ] crushed it.
56:25
Absolutely crushed it this week.
57:51
So If we're starting to slow down here, I don't necessarily think we are. Um I
57:57
think that we can continue much lower on this, especially with ES being so close to these lows. Yeah, we're going to
58:02
spank that. But I I don't know. I made my money for the day. I'm not going to
58:08
close out of everything just yet, but um I I am going to get off this um
58:18
get off this trade recap call and you guys can stay updated with the remainder of the money that I um am going to make
58:25
with my Instagram um stories. I something else
58:31
that I need to keep in mind is to close this trade before the weekend. um because this is such a high up stop-loss
58:38
that I really I don't think that we'll reverse all the way back up here. If anything, I'll close like an hour before
58:45
the day before the daily candle closes just so I can get out with whatever
58:50
profit is going to be left on top of this. Um or, you know, who knows? We could come all the way back up here, but
58:56
I don't really think that that's going to happen. So, yeah, thanks you guys for tuning in. undefeated week and [ __ ]
59:04
on all the haters. Once again, peace out.
