00:00:56.920 money in 2025 now let me give you guys a
00:00:59.160 little backstory of where I was at
00:01:01.440 before you guys knew me for who I am tjr

00:01:07.240 don't even call me tjr they call me
00:01:08.960 Tyler and by the end of this video you

00:01:11.840 Tyler because we're going to know each
00:01:13.600 other pretty freaking well okay so let
00:01:15.360 me give you guys some perspective of
00:01:17.200 where I was at before all of this online
00:01:19.920 money thing was real for me so I started
00:01:23.000 off in crypto in high school okay and I
00:01:25.759 got into it I got really freaking lucky
00:01:27.400 I made a bunch of money but then I lost
00:01:28.799 it all and that sparked this huge crazy
00:01:33.200 fascination with making money and it
00:01:35.920 didn't just jump from that just straight
00:01:38.560 into trading and then boom billionaire
00:01:40.759 like no that's that's not how it worked
00:01:43.159 okay I went from that to reselling shoes
00:01:46.640 like I bought multiple sneaker Bots and
00:01:48.759 I was reselling Yeezys I had a whole
00:01:50.360 bunch of Yeezys coming in the house I
00:01:51.719 had a supreme bot I literally would on
00:01:54.600 every single Thursday because I was on
00:01:56.439 PST okay I can't remember what time the
00:01:59.039 Supreme drops happened at but I remember
00:02:02.600 skipping the first 15 minutes of my
00:02:04.719 first period class on Thursday so I
00:02:06.479 could cook on the Supreme drop and I
00:02:08.038 remember the North Face Supreme collab
00:02:10.318 dropped and I cooked on like these three
00:02:12.319 hoodies and I was like no way I'm
00:02:13.800 freaking rich and then I wasn't Rich
00:02:15.800 because I ended up losing a bunch of
00:02:17.160 money on several other drops so trust me
00:02:19.480 I have been through a whole bunch of
00:02:21.319 these different side hustles and things
00:02:23.599 until I found what worked for me I mean
00:02:25.560 even bro I even thought about doing
00:02:27.519 Section 8 housing I thought about doing
00:02:29.120 real estate I tried doing Drop Shipping
00:02:31.440 for like 2 seconds I tried doing the
00:02:33.920 Snapchat Creator method I actually made
00:02:35.920 $3,000 doing that which was pretty cool
00:02:38.400 but it wasn't actual sustainable money
00:02:41.959 that could literally be consistent
00:02:43.680 income on a monthly basis and then after
00:02:46.159 all of that I was like wait H I already
00:02:49.040 made a bunch of money with crypto why
00:02:51.360 and like I you know I just got sucked
00:02:52.680 backed into the space there was
00:02:53.519 something that was so fascinating about
00:02:55.480 it to me so I was like okay I'm going to
00:02:57.200 get back into this I want to start
00:02:58.239 learning about this some more so what do
00:02:59.599 I do do I just start watching YouTube
00:03:01.080 videos I'm going down the rabbit hole I
00:03:02.640 was literally watching a YouTube video
00:03:04.319 that is the like pretty much the exact
00:03:06.080 same type of YouTube video that you're
00:03:07.400 watching right now of me it's weird cuz
00:03:08.959 I'm explaining the YouTube video that I
00:03:11.040 was watching and you guys are now
00:03:12.280 watching that same exact YouTube video
00:03:13.959 where it was like literally 2 hours long
00:03:15.560 and it's like hello this is the beginner
00:03:17.360 guy today trading and this is one pair
00:03:19.680 and then you buy low and then you sell
00:03:21.360 high and boom you're making money okay
00:03:23.120 we're going to get way more advanced
00:03:24.360 than that I'm going to actually make
00:03:25.640 sure you guys are taken care of because
00:03:27.319 after that 2hour video I was like bro I
00:03:29.799 still don't know how to trade and you
00:03:31.480 honestly just left me with a whole bunch
00:03:33.120 of information that now I don't know
00:03:34.599 what to do with so I'm not going to do
00:03:36.040 that to you guys I'm going to make this
00:03:38.280 way easier than what I had to do what I
00:03:41.120 had to do is I had to put in a whole
00:03:42.799 bunch of time a whole bunch of effort
00:03:44.280 sorting through all these YouTube videos
00:03:46.560 trying to figure out what works what
00:03:47.920 doesn't and now I'm going to lay this
00:03:49.879 all out for you guys so you guys don't
00:03:52.239 have to sort through all those BS
00:03:53.519 YouTube videos and you guys can just
00:03:55.079 watch one single YouTube video where I
00:03:56.840 teach you everything about trading I
00:03:58.360 even teach you the strategy about
00:03:59.840 trading and you guys won't have to watch
00:04:02.319 literally anything else it's going to be
00:04:03.680 awesome okay now before we get into just
00:04:06.519 day trading A to Z and we start talking
00:04:08.280 about all of this educational stuff I
00:04:10.000 want to give you guys the option to
00:04:11.360 compare and contrast some of these other
00:04:13.079 online making money methods in 2025 okay
00:04:15.680 so there's a whole bunch of different
00:04:17.040 ways that lots of people are like oh
00:04:18.639 yeah let me start the side hustle and
00:04:20.000 then once the side hustle starts making
00:04:21.798 me more money than my real job then I'm
00:04:23.240 able to quit my real job and then boom
00:04:25.040 billionaire right so that's what
00:04:26.919 everybody wants but it's not as simple
00:04:29.479 as that and it's not as simple as
00:04:30.840 trading okay and it's not as simple as
00:04:33.000 Drop Shipping regardless these side
00:04:34.880 hustles are going to take time and
00:04:36.479 effort however some of them are going to
00:04:38.440 take more time more effort and most of
00:04:41.520 all a whole bunch of money to get
00:04:43.199 started so I want to break down these
00:04:45.240 side hustles just in case trading might
00:04:47.720 not be for you okay if trading isn't for
00:04:50.080 you that's fine I just saved you
00:04:51.919 literally like however long this video
00:04:53.680 is like [ __ ] 5 hours I just saved you
00:04:55.400 5 hours worth of your time but if you do
00:04:57.440 think trading is for you and we go over
00:04:59.280 all these other side hustle so we can
00:05:00.720 actually like confirm like okay we're
00:05:02.039 not going to play these games on Drop
00:05:03.320 Shipping okay Alibaba Express we're not
00:05:05.199 doing that [ __ ] today okay we're just
00:05:06.800 learning about day trading we're
00:05:07.880 sticking to that all right so let's
00:05:09.800 think about it e-commerce okay whole
00:05:12.360 bunch of money up front and I'm assuming
00:05:14.320 the majority of you guys again like we
00:05:15.880 said we're living paycheck to paycheck
00:05:17.240 we're freaking broke right now we do not
00:05:18.919 have a whole bunch of money to be
00:05:20.080 starting a brand new business a brand
00:05:22.160 new freaking brand okay a company we
00:05:25.039 don't have the money to be doing that
00:05:26.440 yet why it's a bunch of upfront costs
00:05:29.199 and it's low margins like regardless of
00:05:31.360 when you start and how you scale it's
00:05:33.360 upfront costs and low margins just no
00:05:35.800 matter what you're paying a whole bunch
00:05:37.199 of money regardless of if you're low
00:05:39.639 capital or high Capital you're still
00:05:41.440 going to be paying a lot of money and
00:05:42.759 you're still going to have low margins
00:05:44.000 to start ever heard of affiliate
00:05:45.840 marketing yeah neither have I and it's
00:05:47.520 for a good freaking reason you ever
00:05:48.880 heard of a millionaire that's an
00:05:49.919 affiliate marketer I haven't get out of
00:05:52.479 here copyrighting bro the amount of DMS
00:05:56.319 I'm look I'm rich and famous or I mean I
00:05:58.880 think I'm a little bit famous but the
00:06:00.160 amount of people that I get in my DMs
00:06:01.759 that say Hey I'm a copywriter do you
00:06:03.520 need me bro no I don't so if that
00:06:06.720 answers your question on if you think
00:06:08.759 being becoming a copywriter I'm somebody
00:06:11.000 that would be considered like a very
00:06:12.759 high ticket client for a copywriter
00:06:14.560 right do I use a copywriter no do any of
00:06:17.560 my friends that are rich and famous use
00:06:19.280 copywriters no so do I think
00:06:21.720 copyrighting is for you no and I can
00:06:23.919 tell you when I tried to do copywriting
00:06:26.080 it did not work out I could not land a
00:06:28.080 client to save my life it's a whole
00:06:29.639 bunch of DMS to all these famous people
00:06:31.520 they leave you on red they don't even
00:06:33.080 see your [ __ ] and if by the look of the
00:06:35.919 draw you're able to sign them they're
00:06:38.080 trying to rinse you out of a whole bunch
00:06:39.680 of time for as little money as possible
00:06:41.759 so we'll leave that one alone but what
00:06:44.199 skill out of all of these side hustles
00:06:47.240 is literally infinitely
00:06:50.520 scalable day trading why is day trading
00:06:53.840 infinitely scalable because the only
00:06:55.840 thing that you're limited by is your
00:06:57.520 capital and luckily there's a whole
00:06:59.599 whole bunch of companies out there in
00:07:00.759 the world that can help us leverage the
00:07:03.240 small amount of capital that we have
00:07:04.759 right now to be able to trade with
00:07:06.199 higher capital and I'll get into that
00:07:07.680 later in this video but just know if you
00:07:09.759 guys are like broke right now you guys
00:07:11.360 don't have a whole bunch of money there
00:07:12.680 are people that are just like you that
00:07:15.039 go from not having anything to literally
00:07:17.639 making 20
00:07:19.319 $30,000 in their first months of
00:07:21.759 becoming a profitable Trader so if that
00:07:23.840 gives you the perspective of what we can
00:07:25.720 do with trading oh yeah it's big time
00:07:28.360 okay and then not only that why is it
00:07:30.879 infinitely scalable because you're only
00:07:32.879 limited by your own Capital so let's say
00:07:34.879 I have a billion dollars and I'm a
00:07:36.240 profitable
00:07:37.520 Trader bankroll okay but when it comes
00:07:41.080 to e-commerce there's only a certain
00:07:43.720 amount of people in the population yes
00:07:45.479 you could sell to every single person in
00:07:47.520 the population but you're still limited
00:07:49.000 to the population size you're still
00:07:50.560 limited to the niche but trading no the
00:07:53.560 only thing that you're limited by is
00:07:54.919 your Capital so you're telling me if I
00:07:57.280 learn the skill of day trading I have an
00:07:59.840 infinitely scalable skill yes that's why
00:08:02.280 day trading is literally one of the most
00:08:04.440 powerful and one of the most useful
00:08:06.000 skills in the freaking world and on top
00:08:08.400 of that this isn't no Drop Shipping one
00:08:10.840 product one hit wonder once you learn
00:08:12.639 the skill of day trading you're set for
00:08:14.520 freaking life and I don't I don't want
00:08:17.360 to like Gaslight you guys into that
00:08:19.319 because day trading it's one of the
00:08:21.159 hardest skills in the world but assuming
00:08:23.840 that you guys are already living a hard
00:08:25.440 life you guys already work hard in your
00:08:27.280 jobs what if we just take all that hard
00:08:29.560 work and put it into day trading I can
00:08:31.159 almost promise you that you'll be able
00:08:32.679 to get out on top just like I was able
00:08:34.240 to get out on top just like all these
00:08:35.599 other people were able to get out on top
00:08:37.120 and again I'm not trying to convince you
00:08:38.839 that this is going to be a super easy
00:08:40.240 path but I am saying that day trading by
00:08:42.839 far is the highest leverage skill in
00:08:46.399 this make money online space you saw all
00:08:48.640 of these meme coin day Traders go from
00:08:51.240 literally broke college students to
00:08:53.880 multi8 figure several millions of
00:08:57.120 dollars in just a couple months now
00:08:59.440 crypto is a whole different story and
00:09:00.920 I'll explain later in this video why we
00:09:02.640 want to stay away from crypto just
00:09:04.079 because it's too volatile there's
00:09:05.399 seasons for it but day trading on the
00:09:07.800 other hand the Market's always going to
00:09:09.880 show up okay the Market's going to show
00:09:11.880 up whether you're in it or not and
00:09:14.160 that's why day trading is so special
00:09:16.399 that's why day trading is the highest
00:09:18.320 leverage skill especially in the year of
00:09:20.600 2025 for us to be able to learn and once
00:09:23.760 you learn it you already know we're set
00:09:26.600 for life bank roll I'm sure a lot of you
00:09:28.880 guys are Wonder ing like okay bet I I
00:09:31.399 know I know trading is bankroll we know
00:09:33.800 trading is is bankroll okay tjr we know
00:09:36.360 it we know it we know it's the best
00:09:37.920 skill ever okay but I want to give you
00:09:40.519 guys some reassurance okay cuz I'm sure
00:09:42.399 a lot of you guys are seeing me like in
00:09:43.760 this freaking cave and you're like damn
00:09:45.079 this guy probably has [ __ ] 1 2 3 4 S
00:09:47.800 monitors and he's just [ __ ] you know
00:09:50.480 breaker 129 3 4 5 6 7 okay yes we have a
00:09:54.160 break of structure on the NASDAQ we're
00:09:55.640 entering Longs okay you that's what you
00:09:58.440 probably think day trading is it's not
00:10:00.519 okay and it's funny because I didn't
00:10:02.680 even start copying setups like this
00:10:05.480 until I started doing YouTube to be able
00:10:07.959 to film videos like this prior to this I
00:10:11.320 was literally just trading on my iPhone
00:10:14.519 I had my charts on my phone I had my
00:10:17.640 brokerage on my phone okay I was doing
00:10:19.839 literally everything on my phone and the
00:10:21.519 only time that I started using a
00:10:22.920 computer for trading was when I started
00:10:25.600 making YouTube videos cuz how else was I
00:10:27.440 going to film it I couldn't film a
00:10:28.600 YouTube video on my phone so that's a
00:10:30.800 huge part about day trading it's like
00:10:32.360 the accessibility to be able to work on
00:10:35.079 your phone from anywhere in the world as
00:10:37.279 long as you have cellular data or a
00:10:39.160 Wi-Fi connection you can do this
00:10:41.200 anywhere and also shout out Elon okay
00:10:44.680 T-Mobile just partnered with starlink
00:10:46.360 you can literally be on Mars and be day
00:10:49.519 trading So eventually when we take that
00:10:51.320 ship up there what are the drop shippers
00:10:53.440 going to do okay they ain't Drop
00:10:55.519 Shipping to Mars you know what I'm going
00:10:57.279 to be doing I'm still trading I'm
00:10:59.320 trading rocket ships up there okay I
00:11:01.399 know that's a that's a funny joke
00:11:02.839 whatever but I'm just telling you that
00:11:04.920 the accessibility that trading has
00:11:07.360 compared to everything else it's
00:11:09.120 GameChanger okay not only that is the
00:11:12.079 flexibility okay I'm going to explain
00:11:14.440 right after this that there are multiple
00:11:16.519 sessions within the market as a whole
00:11:18.760 okay whether you're day trading us
00:11:20.839 equities whether you're trading foreign
00:11:22.639 exchange whether you're trading
00:11:24.200 Commodities whether you're trading
00:11:25.959 crypto there is a time zone a pair and
00:11:29.680 we're going to get into this and a
00:11:31.480 session for every single person no
00:11:33.920 matter where you are in the world to be
00:11:35.800 able to be trading at whatever time
00:11:38.040 doesn't that sound freaking awesome
00:11:39.480 that's what enticed me about trading
00:11:40.720 because I was like man I'm on Pacific
00:11:43.440 Standard time I'm all the way over here
00:11:45.040 in California and Market opens at 6:30
00:11:48.279 a.m. and I'm just a I'm a sleepy head I
00:11:50.320 didn't back then I I didn't want to wake
00:11:51.839 up early so I was like screw that all
00:11:53.320 stay up late and I'll trade London
00:11:54.600 session at 12: or 1 at night and that
00:11:57.560 works for me if you're in Europe New
00:11:59.920 York session it's opening I think it's
00:12:01.920 like in the middle of the night for you
00:12:03.000 guys but what do you guys have London
00:12:04.320 session it's awesome okay there's
00:12:05.600 something for everybody okay and then on
00:12:07.560 top of that the scalability we already
00:12:09.519 talked about that what is trading
00:12:11.680 bankroll okay why is it bankroll because
00:12:14.519 trading is by far the highest leverage
00:12:16.560 skill that you can learn in today's day
00:12:18.800 and age why because the only thing that
00:12:20.600 you are limited by is your own capital
00:12:22.519 and just like I said before I know you
00:12:24.000 guys are thinking well I ain't got no
00:12:25.399 bankroll I ain't got no Capital don't
00:12:27.160 worry there are companies that help you
00:12:29.279 guys solve this problem okay and there's
00:12:31.760 a whole bunch of softwares and
00:12:35.519 it I I love trading so much and I can
00:12:38.040 talk about it for hours and I am going
00:12:39.440 to talk about it for hours to you guys
00:12:41.880 and I locked myself in this room today
00:12:43.720 so I can explain to you guys why I love
00:12:45.519 trading so much and hopefully by the end
00:12:48.279 of this video I can transfer the skill
00:12:49.639 to you guys so hopefully I either won
00:12:51.880 scared off all the Nerds that don't
00:12:53.480 think day trading is going to get them
00:12:54.680 rich in 2025 hopefully I brought in
00:12:56.800 everybody who thinks day trading will
00:12:58.480 help them get rich and is the highest
00:13:00.160 leverage skill that they can learn in
00:13:01.639 2025 and with that being said let's
00:13:04.199 learn how to [ __ ] day trade in 2025
00:13:06.519 baby there are around 30 different types
00:13:09.839 of trading okay I'm going to teach you
00:13:12.440 guys the most common which is day
00:13:14.320 trading okay which means we are entering
00:13:16.560 into trades within the same day and we
00:13:18.519 are exiting trades within the same day
00:13:20.800 okay there's a whole bunch of different
00:13:22.040 types of trading there's technical
00:13:23.639 trading there's momentum trading there's
00:13:25.160 algorithmic trading there's swing
00:13:26.480 trading there's fundamental trading
00:13:28.040 there's a whole bunch of different typ
00:13:29.120 typ of trading but honestly those never
00:13:31.160 worked out for me I attempted some of
00:13:32.920 them and most of all they're just way
00:13:35.000 more confusing than just the regular
00:13:37.800 most common form of day trading which is
00:13:40.240 getting in and getting out within the
00:13:42.000 same day and then what trading bankroll
00:13:44.560 so for everybody that doesn't know
00:13:46.600 anything about day trading don't worry
00:13:48.199 I'm going to break it down ready on the
00:13:50.360 chart when it's low you want to buy it
00:13:53.399 and then when it goes High you want to
00:13:55.120 sell it boom you're rich thank you guys
00:13:57.920 for watching I'm I'm kidding I'm kid
00:13:59.680 okay but on top of that the nice thing
00:14:02.040 about day trading I feel like a lot of
00:14:03.320 people don't understand this they're
00:14:04.680 like what happens if uh the market goes
00:14:06.920 down you can't trade that day well yes
00:14:08.759 you can that's actually called a short
00:14:10.199 position so you can actually sell when
00:14:12.240 it's up high and then buy those shares
00:14:15.079 back for a lesser price and you can
00:14:17.560 actually still make money doing that so
00:14:19.480 there's two different types of positions
00:14:21.120 that we can take we can take a buy
00:14:23.120 position or we can take a sell position
00:14:26.000 M pretty cool so that's another nice
00:14:27.880 thing about day trading and that's why I
00:14:29.519 said I want to stay away from the crypto
00:14:31.199 because crypto most of the time you're
00:14:33.079 only making money buying for the most
00:14:35.360 part unless you're doing leverage
00:14:36.399 trading blah blah blah we don't want to
00:14:37.680 talk about that but for day trading for
00:14:40.399 us we have accessibility on both sides
00:14:43.360 so that's why day trading is such a high
00:14:44.800 leverage skill because not only can we
00:14:47.079 buy low sell High we can sell high and
00:14:51.360 then buy back lower and make money in
00:14:53.720 either direction of the market so let's
00:14:55.519 say the market crashes no housing crash
00:14:59.399 2008 ra what happens what happens if the
00:15:02.199 price goes down well you can still make
00:15:04.199 money and that's why day trading is the
00:15:06.480 highest leverage skill that you guys can
00:15:07.800 have because when everybody's panicking
00:15:09.360 financial crisis we're still getting
00:15:11.440 rich now I want to break down because
00:15:13.639 again this is like bare minimum base
00:15:16.639 level of trading expertise required here
00:15:20.199 like just how do you make money from
00:15:22.120 Trading and I know explain like you buy
00:15:24.000 low and you sell high but I'm going to
00:15:26.320 do a little high school teacher here for
00:15:28.720 you play the economics teacher in high
00:15:30.920 school I'm going to teach you guys about
00:15:32.720 the stock market okay let's say little
00:15:35.040 Timmy I am Timmy wants to buy one share
00:15:37.720 of Apple I don't even know how much a
00:15:39.120 share of Apple is but let's say it's
00:15:40.560 worth a hundred bucks just for
00:15:41.759 Simplicity s okay I go to my little
00:15:44.959 brokerage on my phone and I say cck buy
00:15:47.759 one share of Apple back in the olden
00:15:49.600 days and the reason why I have to
00:15:50.680 explain this back in the olden days is
00:15:52.319 because this is still how our system
00:15:54.240 works it's just digitalized and it's
00:15:56.319 simplified for us which is better for us
00:15:59.160 because we're able to do these
00:16:00.279 transactions super fast but back in the
00:16:01.920 day when you wanted to buy a share of
00:16:04.240 Apple you would have to make several
00:16:06.040 different phone calls to like The
00:16:07.600 Brokerage to the New York Stock Exchange
00:16:09.560 whatever and then they would ship in the
00:16:11.279 mail like your actual freaking paper
00:16:14.199 share and then it's like boom I have my
00:16:16.399 share and then you would have to like
00:16:17.920 call in every day or whatever however
00:16:20.000 many days that you own that share and
00:16:22.040 you're like hey has price gone up yet or
00:16:23.759 oh no is is my share worth less money
00:16:26.160 like what do I do that's how it worked
00:16:28.240 in the olden days is okay you would get
00:16:29.639 this piece of paper and it would say
00:16:31.000 like boom you own one share of Apple all
00:16:33.399 right and your share is worth a certain
00:16:35.720 price and price fluctuates on a whole
00:16:37.959 bunch of different things okay it
00:16:40.199 fluctuates based off of news it
00:16:41.959 fluctuates based off of price action
00:16:43.720 which is what I'm going to be teaching
00:16:44.959 you guys how to read and when you wanted
00:16:46.880 to sell ideally you're selling for a
00:16:49.199 higher price so let's say me little
00:16:51.040 Timmy goes calls his little brokerage
00:16:53.199 and says hey I want to buy a share of
00:16:55.680 Apple for $100 obviously I can't just
00:16:58.399 name my price but let's say Apple's
00:17:00.079 share price is worth $100 today then
00:17:02.880 following that 2 months later whatever
00:17:05.119 the most crazy news in the entire world
00:17:07.799 about Apple Apple drops a time machine
00:17:10.439 and boom two months later Apple's stock
00:17:12.839 is now worth three times more than what
00:17:15.199 I bought it at so it's now worth 300
00:17:16.959 bucks then I call on my brokerage and
00:17:18.520 say Hey I want to sell my share boom we
00:17:20.959 sell the share what do I make 200 bucks
00:17:23.599 awesome lit right we can do the same
00:17:26.240 thing but now it's digitalized on our
00:17:28.400 phones so instead of calling a bunch of
00:17:30.640 phone numbers we just have these
00:17:32.160 brokerages and these exchanges within
00:17:34.520 our phone that can connect to super cool
00:17:36.960 applications like trading view which I'm
00:17:38.600 going to teach you guys how to set up
00:17:40.080 I'm going to teach you guys how to
00:17:41.120 figure out what brokerage to sign up
00:17:42.799 with okay I'm going to teach you guys
00:17:44.200 what trading platforms you guys can sign
00:17:45.840 up with so we can do these transactions
00:17:48.679 at the speed of freaking light okay at
00:17:50.440 the speed of tapping a button and the
00:17:52.440 nice thing about that is we're able to
00:17:54.080 get in and get out with Precision so
00:17:56.960 we're not waiting for our Brokers to get
00:17:58.640 off the line and say like boom you sold
00:18:00.799 and then like oh price drops a little
00:18:02.240 bit oh damn I I made less money no we're
00:18:04.440 getting in and we're getting out with
00:18:05.600 the tap of a button and that's why day
00:18:07.960 trading is so great now because we're
00:18:10.240 doing it on our phones and the age of
00:18:12.159 technology is just taking us so much
00:18:13.760 farther and that's why it's so much
00:18:14.799 easier to make money online but I know
00:18:16.679 that sounds super crazy and I know that
00:18:18.280 sounds like you got to be some freaking
00:18:19.840 genius but look at me I'm I'm a
00:18:23.159 [ __ ] and I make a [ __ ] ton of money
00:18:26.320 from trading on a day-to-day basis and
00:18:28.360 on a L basis and on a yearly basis so if
00:18:31.320 a [ __ ] can do it sorry for using the
00:18:33.799 hard R you can do it too and I'm sure
00:18:36.880 the majority of you guys are smarter
00:18:38.440 than me so I'm sure the majority of you
00:18:40.679 guys will be able to get really good at
00:18:42.440 this and probably better than me in the
00:18:44.080 future which is awesome I'm I'm this is
00:18:46.919 why I do the [ __ ] so you guys can be
00:18:49.559 just like me except not [ __ ] it's
00:18:52.120 awesome it's great so don't get
00:18:54.360 overwhelmed I know brokerage exchange
00:18:57.240 tapping buttons byy low sell okay I know
00:18:59.360 it seems overwhelming but I'm going to
00:19:00.679 cover all that in this video and how you

00:22:19.559 custom designed my chart to look really
00:22:22.760 freaking good okay you guys don't have
00:22:25.159 that luxury just yet but what I am going

00:22:29.840 make your chart look just like mine with
00:22:31.600 these beautiful blue and black candles
00:22:33.880 if you guys aren't discriminatory to
00:22:37.159 Candle color that's fine what you guys
00:22:39.279 are going to do is you guys are going to
00:22:40.799 go ahead and rightclick on the chart and
00:22:43.440 then you guys are going to scroll down
00:22:44.640 to settings and then you guys can set it
00:22:46.760 up with whatever colors okay you guys
00:22:48.880 can do red you guys can do green you
00:22:51.960 guys can do yellow you know you guys can
00:22:54.520 do [ __ ] black on black you know I I'm
00:22:58.880 hey bro if you like that you like that
00:23:01.520 you can do Wi on black get a little
00:23:03.320 light skin in there okay you guys can do
00:23:05.679 that however you guys like okay these
00:23:07.480 are my chart settings most of the time
00:23:09.840 your chart is going to look pretty
00:23:12.120 freaking disgusting at the start and
00:23:14.159 it's going to be like green red there's
00:23:15.760 going to be a whole bunch of BS in the
00:23:17.640 background okay so let me go through
00:23:20.799 here I'm pretty sure this is somewhat
00:23:23.919 important we have like the previous day
00:23:25.480 close that we want to hide so I'll just
00:23:27.080 go ahead and you guys can cop this you
00:23:28.880 guys can change it however you guys want
00:23:30.559 just make it look pretty okay that's one
00:23:32.039 of the things that I value the most
00:23:33.679 about my charts is like first and
00:23:35.640 foremost I I want my charts to be clean

00:24:07.720 that so boom once you guys have your
00:24:10.240 charts looking nice and sexy we are
00:24:13.360 going to actually put a pin in trading
00:24:16.679 view for now now that we have trading
00:24:18.320 view set up we're going to put a pin in
00:24:20.279 it and I'm going to explain these little
00:24:22.120 candle s are how to read them what they
00:24:24.840 mean okay and I'm going to be explaining
00:24:27.520 these foreign change pairs I'm going to
00:24:29.640 be explaining Commodities gold I'll even
00:24:32.399 explain crypto for a little bit okay and
00:24:34.200 we're going to understand what all this
00:24:36.039 means how we can read it how we can
00:24:37.880 actually make money from this Market but
00:24:39.799 in order for us to make money we
00:24:41.480 actually have to be set up with a
00:24:42.600 brokerage where we can deposit money
00:24:44.559 where we can withdraw money and where we
00:24:46.279 we can actually execute these trades
00:24:47.760 because on trading view we're not doing
00:24:50.320 any of that this is just where we're
00:24:52.080 just marking [ __ ] up okay we need a
00:24:54.360 brokerage again remember little Timmy he
00:24:56.520 calls his brokerage and he says hey can
00:24:57.960 I buy the shares this is how we're going
00:24:59.640 to be buying and selling selling and
00:25:01.919 buying okay so with that being said
00:25:04.120 let's jump over to how to find a
00:25:06.080 brokerage how to get how to get set up
00:25:07.720 on a trading platform because this is
00:25:09.200 our chartwork platform I'm going to show
00:25:11.039 you guys how you guys can get set up on
00:25:12.600 a trading platform all right so there's
00:25:14.720 a plethora like literally millions of
00:25:17.799 different brokerages that you guys can
00:25:19.600 go through in order to start trading and
00:25:21.880 start trading on their platform start
00:25:23.600 trading on their apps on your phone
00:25:25.559 start trading on the apps on their apps
00:25:27.559 on your computer okay it really just
00:25:29.360 depends on what suits you best okay and
00:25:32.120 what platform or what brokerage you
00:25:34.919 think best suits you okay so I
00:25:37.520 personally don't trade options so
00:25:39.760 options is out of the park for me if you
00:25:41.679 guys wanted came here to learn about
00:25:43.320 options byebye okay um I'm not going to
00:25:45.840 teach you guys about options in here but
00:25:47.720 I am going to teach you guys a really
00:25:49.200 solid strategy on how to actually make
00:25:50.720 money in trading so if you guys want to
00:25:52.480 apply that to options by all means but
00:25:54.200 I'm not going to teach you guys how to
00:25:55.320 set up an options trading account okay
00:25:57.039 I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
00:25:59.120 actually get started with just day
00:26:01.000 trading okay using leverage on your own
00:26:03.840 Capital just through the account not
00:26:06.600 like leveraging specific positions okay
00:26:08.799 so the brokerage that I use is hero
00:26:11.120 effects that's the one that works the
00:26:13.159 best for me okay I trade indexes and
00:26:15.520 then occasionally I'll trade foreign
00:26:17.039 exchange so that's what works best for
00:26:19.080 me sometimes these Futures brokerages
00:26:21.640 have really strict regulations on the
00:26:24.279 type of Leverage that you guys can use
00:26:25.799 and especially if you guys are lower
00:26:28.559 Capital individuals and you guys are
00:26:30.480 just getting it started in day trading
00:26:32.440 these big brokerages like trade evade
00:26:35.960 and trade station you just straight up
00:26:38.080 won't be able to trade on them because
00:26:40.200 you guys don't have enough money to
00:26:41.880 trade with them so instead you guys
00:26:44.159 would go over to a cfd brokerage such as
00:26:46.480 hero effects where you guys can leverage
00:26:48.000 your money more and be able to actually
00:26:49.440 start trading with less money again you
00:26:51.679 guys can literally just type in trading
00:26:53.159 brokerage look through like a whole
00:26:55.159 bunch of all of these different
00:26:56.200 brokerages find out what works best for
00:26:57.960 you me personally I use hero effects
00:26:59.880 they're great I can deposit I can
00:27:01.399 withdraw within like seconds and it
00:27:03.720 works great for me so with that being
00:27:05.480 said I'm going to go onto the hero
00:27:06.960 effects dashboard and show you guys how
00:27:08.720 to get set up on there again if you guys
00:27:11.320 want to go through a different brokerage
00:27:12.840 that's completely fine I'm just not
00:27:14.520 really going to go over that okay so
00:27:16.679 with that being said let's jump onto
00:27:17.919 hero effect's website also I'll leave a
00:27:19.760 little Link in the description I have a
00:27:21.360 little affiliate with them um so if you
00:27:23.080 guys want to sign up with hero effect
00:27:24.520 and if you guys appreciate all the info
00:27:25.880 that I've been giving with you guys it
00:27:27.120 would be a huge support if if you guys
00:27:28.440 just signed up with my link right
00:27:29.840 underneath here in the description and
00:27:31.520 yeah they're super solid Brokers for me
00:27:33.440 I trade on them consistently and have
00:27:35.399 been trading with them for a while so
00:27:36.880 let's get into it so once you guys go
00:27:39.399 through that link it'll have you guys
00:27:41.159 sign up and whatever and it's going to
00:27:42.919 take you guys to a page that looks like
00:27:44.360 this and this is all the different tra
00:27:45.960 trading platforms this is also why I
00:27:47.840 love hero effects is because they
00:27:49.039 literally give you a various like
00:27:51.600 multiple different types of apps
00:27:53.559 websites and different trading platforms
00:27:55.480 to trade on versus other again big
00:27:58.159 brokerage is they don't give you guys
00:28:00.120 any sort of variety they're like hey you
00:28:02.000 have to use this one specific platform
00:28:03.919 and it's like what if that platform
00:28:05.279 sucks luckily hero effect gives you
00:28:07.480 literally as so many options okay me
00:28:10.519 personally I use trade locker and I like
00:28:12.640 trading on the app so again you would
00:28:15.480 just go on your phone you can literally
00:28:16.760 just look up trade Locker in the app
00:28:18.440 store and then go ahead and download
00:28:19.799 that and then they will give you guys an
00:28:21.799 email once you guys have signed up your
00:28:23.600 account details and your password as you
00:28:25.720 guys can see I have 35 freaking th000
00:28:28.600 just sitting in my wallet balance right
00:28:29.840 now this is going to be useful because I
00:28:32.080 can either deposit this in back into a
00:28:34.399 live account because this is just
00:28:35.840 sitting on my dashboard wallet okay it's
00:28:38.120 not in my trading account and it's not
00:28:40.039 in my bank account yet so this is just
00:28:42.200 the in between this is why a broker like
00:28:44.200 her effect effect is super useful
00:28:45.760 because again they have different
00:28:47.399 withdraw methods okay you can withdraw
00:28:49.240 in crypto you can do like bank transfer
00:28:51.360 just a whole bunch of methods and it's
00:28:52.720 great and especially for me I'm pretty
00:28:54.679 I'm I love crypto and I like investing
00:28:56.799 in it so when I withdraw most time I
00:28:58.399 just do it through crypto and it hits in
00:29:00.000 literally seconds so for me I do it
00:29:02.760 through the trade Locker app they will
00:29:04.480 send you guys a little email with your
00:29:06.880 account username with your account
00:29:08.559 password and you guys just go onto the
00:29:10.480 app you guys plug in your username and
00:29:12.279 password and it's locked in from there
00:29:14.200 again they have a whole bunch of
00:29:15.480 different trading platforms that you
00:29:16.919 guys can use if you guys are on PC or
00:29:19.880 laptop whatever you guys can do the web
00:29:22.080 Trader which is it brings up a little
00:29:23.760 tab where you guys can trade on trade
00:29:25.000 Locker there and if you guys want to
00:29:26.919 trade on desktop there's literally like
00:29:28.880 a full-on app called trade Locker that
00:29:31.320 you guys can download and then it's the
00:29:32.720 same login process they're going to send
00:29:34.200 you guys an email you guys are going to
00:29:35.720 get your username and password you guys
00:29:37.240 are going to log in and then from there
00:29:39.039 you guys will be all set okay on top of
00:29:41.799 that while we're on the talking about
00:29:44.880 brokerages not only is a brokerage super
00:29:47.799 useful for us to be able to deposit and
00:29:50.039 withdraw money right that's our end goal
00:29:51.919 with day trading is to what bankroll
00:29:54.399 right but before we can even get started
00:29:56.279 with the bankroll we need to learn learn

00:30:07.200 to do that and again like a lot of
00:30:09.559 people online and on YouTube will be
00:30:12.320 like hey use my affiliate link sign up

00:32:34.320 trust me I felt bro the beginner the
00:32:37.440 beginner trading video that I watched
00:32:39.639 was like literally was exactly what I
00:32:41.960 told you guys like sign up with this
00:32:43.880 brokerage deposit $1,000 and you're
00:32:46.600 going to be rich and I did that guess
00:32:49.200 what happened to that thousand within
00:32:50.679 the
00:32:52.120 day0 remaining okay and that was
00:32:54.159 literally all the money that I had so
00:32:56.760 we're already putting you guys on a
00:32:58.440 better track here we're going to be not
00:33:01.120 putting money up front trading view free
00:33:04.159 demo account free the highest [ __ ]
00:33:06.559 leverage skill in the world okay so I'm
00:33:08.159 going to show you guys how you guys can
00:33:09.559 set up a demo account on hero effect
00:33:11.240 okay so there's going to be a page that
00:33:13.120 says accounts right here okay you guys
00:33:15.320 are going to click on it and then it's
00:33:16.360 going to say Live account
00:33:19.080 no no Live accounts yet we need to learn
00:33:22.240 the skill of trading okay we need to
00:33:24.559 learn the skill of trading first there's
00:33:26.080 Live accounts and then there's demo
00:33:27.840 accounts we want the demo okay we want
00:33:30.840 that fake money we want to learn the
00:33:33.120 skill of trading without having to risk
00:33:34.679 money that's like the a good comparison
00:33:36.720 of this is like you having never played
00:33:39.159 basketball before in your life and you
00:33:41.039 go to the black top with like a th000
00:33:43.080 bucks in your pocket you've never played
00:33:44.760 basketball before in your life and you
00:33:46.000 go up to people that are playing really
00:33:48.240 good players and you're like yo I got a
00:33:51.480 bando for whoever's trying to run ones
00:33:54.399 you slap that [ __ ] down and then what
00:33:55.960 do you do you [ __ ] lose obviously why
00:33:58.600 cuz it's your first time playing
00:33:59.679 basketball it's your first time trading
00:34:01.480 versus if you just show up to the park
00:34:03.760 with no bread and you just keep playing
00:34:06.559 until you get good until you get really
00:34:09.040 [ __ ] good and then you switch over
00:34:12.440 from the demo to the Bando in the pocket
00:34:15.560 slap that [ __ ] down and now you're
00:34:17.119 cooking the 60-year-old that's got ankle
00:34:19.239 braces on and you're hitting them with
00:34:21.159 that [ __ ] jelly okay sorry that was a
00:34:24.560 little that was we're getting off off
00:34:26.480 track here but you you get what I'm
00:34:28.040 saying the demo account it's where we
00:34:29.918 want to go okay so again I use trade
00:34:32.079 Locker there's a whole bunch of
00:34:33.960 different like whatever configurations
00:34:37.239 there's demo zero okay which means low
00:34:39.918 spreads and zero commission there's demo
00:34:42.199 raw
00:34:43.639 dog okay sorry that means raw spreads
00:34:47.480 and fixed commissions okay and then
00:34:49.399 there's or those are the only two for
00:34:51.159 trade Locker okay me personally I do low
00:34:54.879 spreads and no commission you guys can
00:34:57.280 you guys can choose whichever one you
00:34:59.119 guys like again you guys don't really
00:35:00.680 know much about this I I would just go
00:35:02.240 with demo zero okay that's the that's
00:35:04.680 the best one that works for me cuz I
00:35:06.160 prefer low spreads and zero commissions
00:35:08.040 than fixed commission and raw spreads I
00:35:10.440 I don't like to get [ __ ] raw I would
00:35:12.359 rather you know wrap it and tap it you
00:35:15.560 know what I'm saying and okay we're
00:35:17.280 getting way too confused here demo
00:35:19.760 account we got it set up same thing here
00:35:21.760 we're going to click on the account and
00:35:23.280 then boom once we set up that account
00:35:24.920 herox is going to send you an email and
00:35:26.520 say boom you got your username you got

00:37:24.240 get going all right bet so it's going to
00:37:27.560 take us through here and then boom jump
00:37:29.680 scare this is our day trading account
00:37:32.359 okay as you guys can see it says demo
00:37:34.480 right here this is fake money we have
00:37:37.359 $100,000 worth of fake money so now you
00:37:40.000 guys are probably overwhelmed we're
00:37:41.680 looking at a crypto chart right now we
00:37:43.760 don't want to be looking at a crypto
00:37:45.200 chart but eventually when we get back
00:37:47.319 over here to trading View and we're
00:37:49.280 analyzing pairs like Euro USD ideally we
00:37:52.640 are going to be pulling up okay let's do
00:37:55.240 foreign exchange Majors they're blacked
00:37:57.160 out because the Market's closed right
00:37:58.680 now it's a Sunday but look we have the
00:38:01.119 same exact chart that we are looking at
00:38:02.880 on trading view so we're actually able
00:38:04.920 to execute trades on trade Locker while
00:38:07.760 looking see it's the same chart boom EUR
00:38:10.760 USD Euro USD so the only thing that
00:38:13.800 we're using this for is to execute
00:38:17.079 trades okay and again they have an app
00:38:19.440 on your phone where you guys can execute
00:38:21.160 trades as well and we're going to be
00:38:22.800 using this to do chart workor because at
00:38:24.960 the end of the day this is just like
00:38:26.520 kind of a it's like a trading view
00:38:28.440 integration here some people are weird
00:38:30.880 and they like doing their chart workor
00:38:32.960 on here but then it's like okay I have
00:38:34.640 to redo my chart settings and I don't
00:38:36.800 want it black not that I'm you know
00:38:38.720 whatever but I like my charts looking
00:38:40.920 clean and it's just way more preferable
00:38:42.839 for me to be on trading view with this
00:38:45.400 clean setup rather than doing the chart
00:38:48.560 work on here and then also having to
00:38:50.119 manage positions it's just it brings a
00:38:52.079 lot in the mix here so even though the
00:38:54.440 markets the foreign exchange markets are
00:38:56.280 closed right now I'll just do an example
00:38:58.160 on crypto for you guys so again ideally
00:39:00.520 you guys aren't trading crypto it's a
00:39:02.200 volatile market right now whatever there
00:39:04.079 was just a whole bunch of news on
00:39:05.319 bitcoin but down here is where we have
00:39:08.359 our positions okay and I'm going to get
00:39:10.800 into this again later when we start
00:39:13.240 explaining these pairs how they work why
00:39:15.240 they go up why they go down and then
00:39:17.040 we're going to go into the strategy of
00:39:18.680 how to actually Place trades and I'm
00:39:20.240 going to go over a couple tools on how
00:39:22.400 you guys can use risk management because
00:39:24.079 risk management is I mean there's a
00:39:26.280 whole bunch of things to cover in this
00:39:27.720 video and we're just getting started but
00:39:29.480 hopefully like trading is starting to
00:39:31.000 make a little bit more sense to you guys
00:39:32.280 now like hopefully we're we're bridging
00:39:34.640 that gap of I don't know anything about
00:39:36.200 trading um to trading is bankroll to
00:39:39.720 okay I'm getting set up with trading and
00:39:42.000 then by the end of this you guys are
00:39:43.280 going to be like hey I know everything
00:39:44.880 there is to know about trading including
00:39:47.160 strategy including risk management
00:39:48.839 including how to control my headp space
00:39:50.720 my emotions whatever okay but I need to
00:39:53.240 show you guys how to use this thing
00:39:54.960 first how to actually Place trades so
00:39:56.440 right now this is like this is the
00:39:57.920 lowest size that I can enter into a
00:40:01.280 Bitcoin trade and bit Bitcoin and crypto
00:40:04.119 is a 24/7 market so the markets are open
00:40:06.920 247 I don't trade crypto I mean I do
00:40:10.079 like super long-term investing in it but
00:40:12.079 that's besides the point I'm not
00:40:13.800 actively trading it I trade indexes and
00:40:15.640 indexes are closed over the weekend but
00:40:17.480 a brief example of how you guys would
00:40:19.119 enter into a trade let's say this is my
00:40:21.680 allocated risk for the day I'll teach
00:40:24.400 you guys again later in this video how
00:40:26.480 you guys can actually actually calculate
00:40:28.119 risk using a risk siiz calculator but
00:40:31.480 let's say I want to place a trade on
00:40:33.760 bitcoin and I want to place a buy cuz
00:40:36.200 wow look at that price is price is going
00:40:38.240 up I want to place a buy okay I confirm
00:40:40.960 that and then boom look at that oh my
00:40:43.319 God oh my God oh my gosh we're up we're
00:40:46.440 up oh [ __ ] now we're down $45 oh [ __ ]
00:40:51.119 yeah ramp this baby up give me more give
00:40:53.720 me more I want more
00:41:02.720 we're down $32 but sorry got a little
00:41:06.040 bit excited
00:41:08.119 everybody um oh [ __ ] we might we might
00:41:11.880 take profit okay sorry I I need to teach
00:41:13.839 you guys how to anyways now we're in one
00:41:15.880 two three four whatever four freaking
00:41:18.319 positions but we can see what's my
00:41:20.040 profit and loss in fake money again I'm
00:41:23.079 down $38 $34 this is fluctuating what's
00:41:26.520 my current equity like in my account
00:41:28.839 balance how much margin am I using so
00:41:31.240 you're probably thinking like okay how
00:41:32.640 do I even know how much money I'm
00:41:34.240 risking how much money am I going in
00:41:36.319 with right A lot of people are like well
00:41:38.200 how much money do you go in with every
00:41:40.040 trade and I'm going to get to that later
00:41:42.000 but I just wanted to show and explain to
00:41:43.680 you guys how you guys can get in get in
00:41:45.680 and get out of Trades okay so I that was
00:41:47.240 a buy position right so how the [ __ ] do
00:41:49.440 we get out of this trade okay let me
00:41:51.839 move my head down so you can see what
00:41:53.440 this looks like I'm a little baby ant
00:41:55.920 now but you guys can see 1 2 3 4 buy
00:41:59.480 positions on bitcoin we can see how much
00:42:01.880 each of them are up so there's a whole
00:42:03.800 bunch of actions over here if I'm like
00:42:06.240 literally printing bread I can share the
00:42:08.599 position to my friends and be like yeah
00:42:10.800 trading's bankroll idiot you should
00:42:12.359 watch tjr trades video then you guys can
00:42:14.480 edit the position you guys can do a
00:42:16.240 partial close on the position you guys
00:42:18.520 can fully close the position so let's
00:42:20.200 say I'm like okay this trade is looking
00:42:22.119 scary I want to get out of this boom we
00:42:24.400 hit close position we confirm Dam it we
00:42:27.839 just lost $24 so that like fully closed
00:42:32.079 that one position I'm still down $25
00:42:35.640 floating on these other three positions
00:42:37.880 here right why because we entered into
00:42:40.319 buy positions here and price has just
00:42:42.440 gone down ever since man tjr sucks at
00:42:44.720 trading right but there's a bunch of
00:42:46.839 other actions that I want to teach you
00:42:48.400 guys about while we're on this platform
00:42:50.319 and while we're on the topic of this so
00:42:52.280 that was a full close what if we want to
00:42:54.240 just close a little bit of this position
00:42:56.440 so the way that at least hero effects
00:42:59.200 and trade Locker calculates position
00:43:01.599 size it does it on lots and I'll explain
00:43:04.040 what these are and I'll explain how we
00:43:05.880 can calculate how much we're going in
00:43:08.400 with per trade based on lot size and
00:43:10.880 there's a really super easy calculator
00:43:12.960 that I'm going to show you guys how to
00:43:14.240 use that makes your life way simpler
00:43:17.000 okay but right now I entered in with
00:43:19.240 0.1 Lots on this so let's say I only
00:43:22.040 want to close half of this position what
00:43:23.920 do I do I just crank this down to 0.05
00:43:26.839 lot lot and then what can I do I can
00:43:28.559 press close confirm 0.05 out of the one
00:43:31.800 lots and now I have not only this one
00:43:35.599 fully closed position but I also have
00:43:38.480 this position that I close for 0.5 lots
00:43:41.640 and then I still have that remaining
00:43:45.119 position with 0.05 Lots still open okay
00:43:49.480 and then let's say I want to close the
00:43:51.319 remainder of it
00:43:52.800 0.05 close confirm boom now I fully have
00:43:56.720 closed out of that remainder of the
00:43:58.960 position now there's another thing that
00:44:01.000 I need to teach you guys about that is
00:44:02.440 going to be very useful as time goes on
00:44:05.480 in your trading career and hopefully it
00:44:07.079 starts at the very beginning of your
00:44:08.440 trading career this is stop loss and
00:44:10.280 take profits I'm going to teach you guys
00:44:12.520 where to strategically put these based
00:44:15.359 on our strategy based so we are actually
00:44:18.800 able to make money and make more money
00:44:21.319 when we win and make less money when we
00:44:23.359 lose so we can end up being profitable
00:44:25.160 Traders okay but first I need to just
00:44:27.359 show you guys how to place these on the
00:44:29.680 on the platform so there's two different
00:44:31.599 ways we can either click on this okay
00:44:34.400 and or sorry we want to edit this
00:44:36.359 position sorry I'm used to it on the
00:44:37.880 phone most of the time on the phone you
00:44:39.160 can just click on the line so you're
00:44:40.359 going to go ahead and click edit
00:44:41.680 position this tool shows up right here
00:44:44.559 we have stoploss and take profit okay
00:44:47.440 these are probably some of the most
00:44:49.200 useful tools in day trading ever okay
00:44:52.599 and this is kind of getting into how
00:44:54.720 much money am I going to make on this
00:44:56.400 trade how much money am I going in with
00:44:58.920 on this trade this is where these tools
00:45:00.760 come in handy okay so again we're in
00:45:03.079 this buy position our stop loss is where
00:45:05.839 we are exiting the trade okay so this is
00:45:08.640 our draft stop loss this is another nice
00:45:10.520 thing about herox in trade Locker see
00:45:12.680 how easy it is for me I can literally
00:45:14.640 just drag it I can drag it and put it
00:45:16.760 wherever so let's say our stop loss is
00:45:20.440 used to show when and where we want to
00:45:24.119 get out of our trade and again I'm going
00:45:26.040 to explain to you guys how we can
00:45:28.440 strategically place these so that we are
00:45:31.319 losing trades at the right time when our
00:45:34.359 idea is invalidated and we are winning
00:45:37.000 and taking profits when our idea has
00:45:39.720 been completed when our strategy has
00:45:41.599 been completed okay and we want to get
00:45:44.440 out because again trading isn't just
00:45:46.160 winwin win win win okay trading is like
00:45:48.160 win loss winwin loss loss win win win
00:45:52.319 win loss loss win loss win loss okay
00:45:55.000 it's always back and forth you're going
00:45:56.599 to have winning days and you're going to
00:45:57.960 have losing days and I'm going to get
00:45:59.520 into that within the psychology portion
00:46:01.200 of this long ass video that you guys are
00:46:03.079 watching and again shout out to
00:46:04.440 everybody has who's been sicking along
00:46:06.040 for this but you guys are going to go go
00:46:10.040 through a period where you're like man I
00:46:12.160 I keep losing or like oh I'd never want
00:46:14.359 to lose no you have to be willing to
00:46:16.800 lose in trading not only to learn from
00:46:19.160 your mistakes but also because no Trader
00:46:22.400 is 100% okay every single Trader misses
00:46:25.240 shots misses trades okay and I'm going
00:46:26.960 going to use a lot of basketball
00:46:28.119 analogies in this video but it's true
00:46:29.800 Michael Jordan has missed a whole bunch
00:46:31.280 of shots in his career but that doesn't
00:46:32.720 stop him from being the goost the same
00:46:34.160 thing with trading we always want to
00:46:35.319 take the shot but we don't know if it's
00:46:37.240 going to go in or not all that we can do
00:46:39.000 is we can train our skill on taking
00:46:41.119 those shots so that the probability of
00:46:43.160 it going in is a lot higher than before
00:46:45.599 so stop loss again I'm going to show you
00:46:48.040 guys how to strategically place this but
00:46:49.599 this is cool there's a couple things
00:46:50.720 here so not only when I drag my stop
00:46:53.240 loss it sets it to the price so see the
00:46:55.720 price is 92 to 645 let's say I want to
00:46:58.920 put it lower it changes it to 91
00:47:02.599 96531 and then it also shows us the
00:47:05.160 percentage of our account balance that
00:47:06.720 we're going to be losing so if we lose
00:47:08.319 this trade we're going to beuse losing
00:47:09.960 way less than 0.01% but we're going to
00:47:12.160 be losing 12 bucks okay from our
00:47:14.680 $100,000 account size that little Timmy
00:47:17.480 really just wanted to be a billionaire
00:47:18.800 with right so again if I move this up
00:47:20.880 what are we going to be losing and this
00:47:22.359 is kind of getting into like how much am
00:47:24.119 I putting in if we lose the trade here
00:47:26.640 how how much did we go in with
00:47:28.800 essentially $9 that's all you need to
00:47:31.160 know there's there's a whole bunch of
00:47:32.559 these beginner day trading videos that
00:47:34.280 are like well when you when you use this
00:47:37.000 this leverage and you have this account
00:47:38.520 balance and then you enter in with this
00:47:39.920 many lot sizes you're technically
00:47:41.480 utilizing the leverage from The
00:47:42.880 Brokerage and then you're actually
00:47:45.240 leveraging your current account balance
00:47:47.200 by 500 or 50x depending on what leverage
00:47:50.280 that you use and then you're going to be
00:47:51.880 entering in with this many contract size
00:47:53.760 which correlates to this many lot sizes
00:47:55.960 and then like shut the [ __ ] up you nerd
00:47:59.160 and just how much am I risking per trade
00:48:03.040 and I had to go through that so I'm
00:48:05.119 telling you guys don't go through that
00:48:07.800 [ __ ] just look at how much am I how much
00:48:10.280 am I going to lose damn it Timmy how
00:48:12.800 much are you losing the family today
00:48:15.480 nine bucks bet your lunch money is on
00:48:18.599 this trade so boom that's stop loss take
00:48:20.599 profit is where we want to win our trade
00:48:22.880 so again let's say we want to win our
00:48:25.319 trade up here how much money are we
00:48:26.800 going to make again we're risking $9 to
00:48:29.559 make $8 it's pretty shitty trade ideally
00:48:32.440 we have a good risk reward and I'm going
00:48:34.319 to talk about that again it's a long ass
00:48:36.319 video but our take profit shows us what
00:48:39.240 price we want to close the trade app so
00:48:41.800 again let's say we want to make $12 boom
00:48:44.559 or take profits up here okay and these
00:48:46.280 are just drafted right now so once I
00:48:47.880 click confirm it means okay I entered
00:48:50.920 into this trade if it hits my takeprofit
00:48:52.760 if I win the trade if I make the shot I
00:48:55.040 make 12 bucks 89 if I lose if I miss the
00:48:58.359 shot I lose
00:49:00.640 $9.83 we confirm that and boom we got
00:49:03.760 the red line and the green lines scary
00:49:05.799 ass lines right and then we can also see
00:49:08.160 on the screen we have stop loss take
00:49:11.000 profit okay and then we can see where
00:49:13.280 the current trade is at so right now
00:49:15.319 this trade we're at a net negative
00:49:19.520 $11.35 and we can constantly track this
00:49:22.440 but we know when this price gets hit we
00:49:24.559 are going to lose how much money not $9
00:49:27.520 if this price gets hit we're going to
00:49:29.280 make $12 and whatever 80 something cool
00:49:32.640 so that's how you guys can enter into
00:49:34.760 trades that's how you guys can exit
00:49:36.480 trades that's how you guys Place take
00:49:38.480 profits that has that's how you guys
00:49:39.920 Place stop losses and again later on in
00:49:42.319 this video I'm going to show you guys
00:49:44.000 how we can strategically place take
00:49:46.440 profits and stop losses so that we can
00:49:48.760 make money day trade I'm going to
00:49:51.160 explain to you guys how you guys can
00:49:53.400 place your stop loss strategically and
00:49:56.280 place your takeprofit strategically so
00:49:58.680 you guys can have a good risk to reward
00:50:01.640 ratio so your rewards are higher than
00:50:04.280 your risks consistently when you're
00:50:06.200 taking trades W in the chat okay there's
00:50:08.680 one more thing actually that I want to
00:50:10.160 show you guys on this program and on
00:50:11.960 this platform on this
00:50:13.640 broker okay so we're going to go ahead
00:50:15.960 and close this trade out we're going to
00:50:17.160 close all of these trades out okay we're
00:50:18.720 going to close position we ended up
00:50:20.280 losing 55 bucks so that was on a buy
00:50:23.000 position okay again we want to buy low
00:50:25.480 and sell High okay I I bought within 1
00:50:28.000 minute and then sold like whatever a
00:50:29.880 couple minutes later so obviously price
00:50:31.599 isn't going to fluctuate that much and
00:50:33.400 it's the weekend low volatility whatever
00:50:35.319 so that was a buy position what happens
00:50:37.799 remember let's say the market crashes
00:50:40.160 and how how do we how do we sell and
00:50:42.240 then how do we how do we enter into a
00:50:44.440 sell position to actually make money
00:50:46.200 because if we sell high and then Buy Low
00:50:48.880 we're still able to make money so it's
00:50:51.160 the same situation right here click sell
00:50:54.559 confirm and that doesn't mean you're
00:50:56.200 selling sing your previous buy positions
00:50:58.400 no it means you're entering into a short
00:51:00.559 trade so there's a long long position
00:51:03.240 means we think price is going to go up
00:51:05.200 we want to buy the thing or we can enter
00:51:06.559 into a short position which means we
00:51:08.720 think the thing's going to go down it's
00:51:10.240 the same situation here we can close the
00:51:12.119 position completely we can partially
00:51:13.760 close the position we can edit it and
00:51:17.280 when we're in short positions where's
00:51:19.119 our stop loss it's going to be above
00:51:21.160 where we entered into into the trade
00:51:22.720 right because how do we end up losing
00:51:24.440 money on short positions price is going
00:51:27.319 to come up and eventually our trade idea
00:51:30.799 will get invalidated if it keeps going
00:51:33.119 higher and higher and we're eventually
00:51:35.119 going to want to get out of this trade
00:51:37.680 at some point in time right so again in
00:51:40.200 this case we're now risking pretty much
00:51:42.799 100 bucks on this stop loss okay so 0.1%
00:51:45.960 of our account balance okay and if price
00:51:48.520 hits this we're going to lose money so
00:51:50.319 now since we're in this short position
00:51:52.760 since we're in this sell position we're
00:51:54.160 trying to sell high and then Buy Low and
00:51:57.520 when we mean Buy Low it just means
00:51:59.880 hitting takeprofit and again I don't
00:52:01.920 even want to go too deep into that
00:52:03.400 because you guys genuinely don't need to
00:52:05.040 know that [ __ ] in order to make money in
00:52:06.599 trading just like straight up you guys
00:52:08.480 don't need to know that [ __ ] just know
00:52:10.119 short position sell position means we
00:52:12.640 want price to go down and we lose trades
00:52:15.160 when price goes up and our stop- loss
00:52:17.160 gets hit and we win trades when price
00:52:19.680 moves down and our take profit gets hit
00:52:23.640 okay so our take profit is now low
00:52:26.000 versus so on a short position our stop
00:52:28.240 loss is above the entry and our
00:52:30.079 takeprofit is below the entry in a buy
00:52:32.160 position in a long position our stoploss
00:52:35.400 is underneath the entry and our
00:52:37.559 takeprofit is above the entry because
00:52:40.160 when we're buying we want to exit when
00:52:42.720 price is at a higher price and when
00:52:44.559 we're selling we want to exit when price
00:52:46.480 is at a lower price cool so when we do
00:52:49.599 this we hit confirm and then boom our
00:52:51.839 stop loss is right here our takeprofit
00:52:53.640 is right here cool so that's how you
00:52:56.960 guys can enter into trades that's how
00:52:58.799 you guys can enter into a long position
00:53:00.520 that's how you guys can set a stoploss
00:53:02.200 that's how you guys can set a takeprofit
00:53:03.799 that's how you guys get set up on trade
00:53:05.880 Locker now what I want to do is swing
00:53:08.680 back around over to trading View and I
00:53:12.119 want to talk to you guys just how to
00:53:14.839 read the charts okay just like on a bare
00:53:17.760 basic fundamental level I want to
00:53:19.599 explain those candlesticks you guys like
00:53:21.720 these candlesticks what they mean how it
00:53:24.280 dictates and what it tells us about
00:53:27.200 price okay I also want to tell you guys
00:53:30.319 like how do these foreign exchange pairs
00:53:32.960 even work like why is the Euro versus
00:53:35.319 the US dollar going down and then going
00:53:38.240 up like we we kind of want to understand
00:53:40.760 some of these things in order to
00:53:42.839 understand like what are we even trading
00:53:44.880 okay it's one thing to just have a
00:53:47.280 strategy and be like Candlestick go this
00:53:49.559 way Candlestick go that way I enter
00:53:51.839 trade because I am tjr sex slave no
00:53:55.640 you're not keep that in the video cuz I
00:53:58.040 want you guys to hear that but you're
00:54:01.440 not not yet okay lock in Twin lock in
00:54:07.480 okay let me explain to you guys how
00:54:09.720 these pairs work okay this is something
00:54:12.680 that you guys are going to see very
00:54:13.760 frequently across all trading okay so
00:54:16.079 these this is a Forex pair so it's the
00:54:17.839 Great British pound against the US
00:54:19.680 dollar you guys see this in crypto all
00:54:21.880 the time you ever wonder why crypto
00:54:23.640 pairs say like BTC slusd it's because
00:54:26.960 it's Bitcoin against the US dollar you
00:54:29.000 ever wonder why gold is
00:54:32.359 xauusd it's because it's gold against
00:54:34.720 the US dollar this is how we trade how
00:54:37.200 we make money in the markets this is
00:54:39.359 super quick and fast explanation because
00:54:42.000 I had to watch a [ __ ] British dude go
00:54:44.480 over this [ __ ] for 50 minutes and I was
00:54:46.280 literally ripping my hair out while I
00:54:48.079 was watching that beginner day trading
00:54:49.640 course and this dude's like this is so
00:54:52.359 important and turns out it's not that
00:54:54.160 important but when your family members
00:54:56.000 are like hey little Timmy explain this
00:54:57.839 Forex [ __ ] that you're doing and you got
00:55:00.200 to come up and you're like I don't know
00:55:02.520 mama I just buy low and so high okay
00:55:06.400 they're going to be like get the [ __ ]
00:55:08.000 off of that [ __ ] you're never going to
00:55:09.680 be successful and that was essentially
00:55:13.000 what happened to me when I couldn't
00:55:14.440 explain it so I'm going to explain this
00:55:16.040 as simple as possible so you can explain
00:55:18.079 it to your families and then you're
00:55:19.559 never going to need to use this [ __ ]
00:55:20.960 again okay twom minute segment of me
00:55:23.160 explaining foreign exchange how this
00:55:24.720 [ __ ] works so this is a Forex pair
00:55:26.640 there's commodity pairs there's crypto
00:55:28.119 Pairs and then there's also like indexes
00:55:30.160 and stuff and we'll get into that later
00:55:31.480 so Forex pairs are literally just quoted
00:55:33.520 pairs okay it's one currency against
00:55:35.520 another okay so in this case the base
00:55:37.839 pair always comes first and the quote
00:55:39.960 currency comes next okay so the base
00:55:42.319 currency Great British pound this
00:55:44.920 essentially is showing how many US
00:55:47.680 dollars is equivalent to one single
00:55:50.520 Great British pound okay so one single
00:55:53.760 Great British pound is equivalent to to
00:55:57.720 $1.32
00:55:59.359 us got it that's literally all it is
00:56:02.799 it's just it's a [ __ ] fraction okay
00:56:05.559 so I know this sounds confusing but the
00:56:08.200 price of a pair is how much of the quote
00:56:10.640 currency quote currency it costs to buy
00:56:14.880 one unit of the base currency so the
00:56:16.920 base currency is always just one okay
00:56:19.880 and and crypto is a really good way of
00:56:22.400 understanding this so like if we go to
00:56:23.760 the btcusd
00:56:26.440 chart I'll literally pull that [ __ ] up
00:56:28.079 right now look
00:56:30.400 btcusd we pull this up what is the price
00:56:33.319 at
00:56:34.760 93,471
00:56:36.359 so one Bitcoin is worth what
00:56:40.680 93,471
00:56:44.160 of these equals how many of these the
00:56:48.480 quote currency is how many of it and
00:56:50.559 most of the time the quote currency is
00:56:52.079 almost always going to be in USD unless
00:56:53.920 you're trading like weird Forex Pairs
00:56:56.039 and by all means like you can trade the
00:56:57.359 Forex pairs but this is just
00:56:59.240 understanding how the [ __ ] works so
00:57:01.000 again Forex pairs it's one the base
00:57:03.880 currency is always worth one and then
00:57:06.280 the quote currency is always what this
00:57:09.400 one is equivalent to so let's say like
00:57:11.680 we wanted to do the pound against the
00:57:14.200 Australian dollar it would be like GBP
00:57:16.720 SL a and then it would equal whatever
00:57:20.200 one pound is equivalent to in Australian
00:57:24.039 dollars right so it's whatever the base
00:57:25.640 currency is equivalent to in the quote
00:57:28.400 currency and that's all you need to know
00:57:30.400 don't be thinking well yeah let me do my
00:57:32.640 research on them [ __ ] pounds no bro
00:57:35.000 don't do your research on them [ __ ]
00:57:36.799 pounds the only thing that you need to
00:57:38.119 know is Big Ben British biscuits and
00:57:41.039 beans okay bro don't be doing any more
00:57:43.359 research on them [ __ ] pounds the only
00:57:45.000 research you need to be doing on the
00:57:46.200 pounds is on the charts right here but
00:57:47.920 that's essentially how price and why
00:57:49.920 price moves in the Foreign Exchange
00:57:51.200 Market so same thing Euro
00:57:53.000 USD okay so if we see this the euro
00:57:56.359 against the US dollar let's let's do a
00:57:59.079 test here this is the price of Euro USD
00:58:02.559 right now and the market is closed so
00:58:05.240 how many dollars is one worth let's wait
00:58:09.440 for the class how many dollars is one
00:58:11.480 EUR
00:58:12.920 worth God [ __ ] damn it Timmy okay
00:58:16.440 it's
00:58:20.280 13738 that's how many dollars one EUR is
00:58:23.160 worth okay now let's do it with gold
00:58:26.720 because there's like Commodities and
00:58:28.240 [ __ ] let's do X auau because that's the
00:58:30.920 sign for gold USD okay again this is the
00:58:34.599 pair gold let's click on
00:58:37.640 it gold what is the price of gold
00:58:41.520 against the dollar
00:58:44.680 $2,858 14 that's how much it costs I I
00:58:48.000 can't remember what like how much gold
00:58:50.480 this is equivalent to I think it's like
00:58:52.200 whatever a gram or something or an ounce
00:58:54.079 I don't know it does not matter we just
00:58:55.520 need to understand this for when we
00:58:57.079 explain to our families how this [ __ ]
00:58:58.359 works okay so that's that's literally it
00:59:00.480 and then last but not least indexes
00:59:02.440 which is what I'm mainly trade it's
00:59:04.799 pretty much the same thing but indexes
00:59:06.920 doesn't have the slusd because indexes
00:59:09.559 are just us indexes anyways so indexes
00:59:13.720 it's just the same exact thing so again
00:59:15.960 if we want to buy one share of the S&P
00:59:19.000 500 how much would it costs $
00:59:22.160 5,954 or how much is one share of the
00:59:24.359 S&P 500 worth5
00:59:27.559 95451 how much is one share of the
00:59:29.880 NASDAQ worth
00:59:32.520 $2,884 okay that's all it is okay
00:59:34.720 foreign exchange indexes crypto
00:59:37.680 Commodities we're learning y'all we're

01:00:29.280 actually get into all the fun [ __ ] like
01:00:31.640 Buy Here Sell Here make a billion dollar
01:00:34.960 whatever we need to understand what
01:00:37.240 these candlesticks even are what they
01:00:39.319 mean what all these little numbers up
01:00:41.799 here mean what these prices mean okay
01:00:44.760 what all these tools can do so that's
01:00:46.599 what I'm going to break down now this is
01:00:48.200 going to be within trading view I'm
01:00:49.680 going to pull up a couple graphs to help
01:00:51.559 you guys understand some things and some
01:00:53.480 Basics and then we're going to get into
01:00:55.559 strateg
01:00:56.480 then we're going to get into risk
01:00:57.799 management then we're going to get into
01:00:59.280 psychology and everything else that you
01:01:01.319 guys are going to need in order to start
01:01:03.400 working on the highest leverage skill
01:01:05.240 literally in the world which is I mean
01:01:07.079 it's so cool to say that I am a [ __ ]
01:01:10.079 with one of the highest leverage skills
01:01:11.960 in the world and you retards can do it
01:01:14.039 too so the first thing that we're going
01:01:15.440 to need to do is understanding these
01:01:18.720 Japanese candlesticks so this is a super
01:01:21.680 good graph and understanding of these
01:01:24.000 candlesticks we'll get into time frames
01:01:26.799 and how those represent these
01:01:28.880 candlesticks a little bit better when we
01:01:30.520 get back on the chart but these are our
01:01:34.000 literally only tools on the chart it's
01:01:36.559 just it's just up and down candles so
01:01:38.720 like how how are these going to help us
01:01:41.720 and how can we use these to our
01:01:43.760 advantage here we go we're getting into
01:01:45.200 the big [ __ ] now okay what is a
01:01:47.240 Candlestick it represents price movement
01:01:50.240 within a certain amount of time and
01:01:52.920 everything that price did within that
01:01:54.680 certain amount of time so each one of
01:01:56.319 these candlesticks represents price
01:01:59.119 movement within a certain amount of time
01:02:01.039 and the certain amount of time is
01:02:02.680 dependent on what time frame you are on
01:02:05.400 on the chart and I'm going to explain
01:02:07.119 that right after this but first I just
01:02:09.359 want us to understand candlesticks in
01:02:11.440 general so this candle right here an up
01:02:14.960 candle right here is called this filled
01:02:18.760 in part is called the body of the
01:02:20.839 Candlestick these little lines right
01:02:23.279 here these snail Trail lines are called
01:02:26.480 Wicks so again this is the body and then
01:02:29.680 notice why they're called candlesticks
01:02:31.400 because they have little Wicks it looks
01:02:32.799 like a Candlestick let me see what I'm
01:02:34.559 saying the Shaded in part is called the
01:02:36.319 body these little lines that go up and
01:02:39.359 down and I call them snail Trails for a
01:02:41.359 reason are called Wicks now before we
01:02:44.760 even get into time frames or anything
01:02:46.599 let's just explain this candle so let's
01:02:48.839 say that we're on the daily time frame
01:02:50.720 and you don't need to understand what
01:02:51.920 that is just yet but let's say that this
01:02:54.599 one candle represents one day worth of
01:02:58.079 price movement so we see open we see low
01:03:01.880 we see close we see high what do all
01:03:03.960 these things mean the open means okay
01:03:07.240 the day started and this is where price
01:03:10.039 was when the day started when this
01:03:12.240 Candlestick opened that was where this
01:03:15.440 right here is where price was at then at
01:03:18.760 some point in time during and throughout
01:03:21.240 that day price moved down to this point
01:03:25.000 in time so that's why I say it's called
01:03:26.799 a snail Trail okay because anywhere that
01:03:29.880 price goes it leaves a trace it Le it's
01:03:33.079 going to leave a wick so the lowest
01:03:35.520 point that price got to on this day was
01:03:39.079 right here how do we know that because
01:03:41.200 of the wick the wick shows us that the
01:03:43.400 highest point that price got to within
01:03:46.240 the day was all the way up here and then
01:03:49.279 where did the price end at on the day so
01:03:53.240 we know that the day opened at this
01:03:55.880 price right here and I know we don't
01:03:57.079 have prices to the side but I'll show it
01:03:58.680 to you guys on the chart after we get
01:04:00.559 through this and I know this is is
01:04:02.480 confusing for you guys right now but you
01:04:04.160 guys will get the hang of it as we start
01:04:06.160 going through this a little bit more and
01:04:07.480 that's why I'm I'm being a little bit
01:04:09.039 more serious now because this is when
01:04:10.440 we're getting into the big [ __ ] okay so
01:04:13.039 right here is where the Candlestick
01:04:15.079 opened and this is where this was the
01:04:17.640 price that the day opened at at some
01:04:21.200 point in time throughout the day price
01:04:24.079 came down to as low as this point and
01:04:27.200 that is marked out by this Wick at some
01:04:29.799 other point throughout the day price got
01:04:32.720 all the way up here how do we know that
01:04:36.079 via this candlesticks Wick and then when
01:04:38.000 the day ended price ended up coming back
01:04:41.240 down and then ending and closing the day
01:04:45.200 right here
01:04:47.039 okay so why is this a bullish
01:04:49.680 Candlestick because we
01:04:51.720 opened at this price and we closed at a
01:04:55.920 higher
01:04:56.960 price now a down Candlestick a bearish
01:05:00.440 Candlestick is the exact opposite so now
01:05:04.400 let's say these are two consecutive
01:05:06.160 daily candles so again this shows like
01:05:08.640 24 hours worth of price action now we
01:05:12.599 closed right here right on the previous
01:05:15.119 day so when this day closes what happens
01:05:18.480 a new Candlestick opens that's why we'll
01:05:21.400 see this bullish Candlestick close at
01:05:23.599 this price and then the next Candlestick
01:05:25.400 open opens at the past candlestick's
01:05:27.960 closing price more often than not okay
01:05:30.039 there's some exceptions but we won't
01:05:31.599 talk about that for now so when this
01:05:33.079 Candlestick closes this Candlestick
01:05:34.880 opens it opens right here at some point
01:05:38.039 in time throughout throughout this day
01:05:40.760 price got up here how do we know that
01:05:43.279 through the wick at some point in time
01:05:45.839 price came all the way down here how do
01:05:48.559 we know that via the candle 6 Wick and
01:05:50.920 then once all 24 hours has finished
01:05:55.359 price PR closed right here how do we
01:05:58.599 know that it's a bearish and down
01:06:00.400 Candlestick because it opened at a
01:06:02.440 higher Point than where it closed at I
01:06:04.440 know this is a bit confusing but we're
01:06:06.279 going to take this slow and steady here
01:06:08.520 I know this is this is super daunting
01:06:10.520 but we're going to get through this and
01:06:12.480 you're going to be amazed at how far you
01:06:14.119 come by the end of this video pause how
01:06:16.440 far you come come on now you get what
01:06:18.240 I'm saying so each one of th this d
01:06:22.200 stands for one day's worth of price
01:06:24.079 action so these are time frames this
01:06:27.520 right now each Candlestick is
01:06:29.920 representative of one day worth of price
01:06:33.720 movement again the price movement is
01:06:36.079 shown via this these candlesticks what
01:06:38.799 happens if I move to the
01:06:41.119 4our time frame we now see price action
01:06:45.079 and these candlesticks now show 4 hours
01:06:48.559 worth of price movement it shows more
01:06:51.079 detail on the chart so when we were on
01:06:53.240 the daily chart we're only seeing like
01:06:56.119 okay this is just one up candle this is
01:06:58.599 24 hours right this Candlestick right
01:07:01.920 here is 24 hours worth of price movement
01:07:05.720 but when we go down to the 4H hour time
01:07:07.640 frame we can see those 24 hours split up
01:07:11.400 into six candlesticks now why cuz 4 * 6
01:07:15.480 = 24 24 hours in a day you get what I'm
01:07:18.000 saying so now we can see it's spread out
01:07:20.200 a little bit more so now each one of
01:07:21.880 these candlesticks represents 4 hours of
01:07:25.240 what price did so on this Candlestick
01:07:27.440 right here for example what did price do
01:07:29.880 in those 4 hours where is the Open high
01:07:32.279 low and close of this candles stick it
01:07:34.119 opened right here how do we know that
01:07:36.400 well because price price went up right
01:07:39.319 so if it closed up then we know the open
01:07:41.520 is right here it opened right here at
01:07:43.720 some point in time during these 4 hours
01:07:46.200 price came
01:07:49.400 down to this price right here
01:07:53.799 $887,000 at some point in time during
01:07:55.920 that 4 hours price came to that price
01:07:58.400 and then also during those 4 hours at
01:08:00.319 some point in time price came all the
01:08:02.319 way up to
01:08:05.119 95,5 and then after those 4 hours were
01:08:08.079 said and done where did price close at
01:08:11.480 $93,500
01:08:13.160 and now we can see on the right hand
01:08:16.679 side see this little timer this is
01:08:18.839 showing how much time is left until this
01:08:22.279 current Candlestick that is forming has
01:08:24.799 to close so this current Candlestick has
01:08:27.319 only been opened for the past what is
01:08:30.479 that it's been like 34 minutes because
01:08:33.000 there's 3 hours and 26 minutes remaining
01:08:36.198 on this and we can see that when this
01:08:38.399 4-Hour Candlestick closed where did the
01:08:40.920 next one open where this 4our
01:08:43.520 Candlestick closed and we can see these
01:08:45.719 Wicks these snail Trails form in real
01:08:49.000 time so right now for the past 35
01:08:52.399 minutes that this new candle has been
01:08:54.000 opened where has price gone it shows us
01:08:56.279 every inch of where price has gone so
01:08:58.600 far in the past 35 minutes how high has
01:09:01.080 price
01:09:02.439 gone it's gone up to
01:09:05.080 $94,200 it opened at
01:09:09.920 $93,500 and right now price is sitting
01:09:13.600 at
01:09:15.520 $93,900 and it hasn't gone lower than
01:09:19.319 its opening price I know this is
01:09:22.560 confusing but we're going to keep going
01:09:25.000 we're going to slowly push you along
01:09:27.158 here now what happens when I pull up the
01:09:30.920 1our time frame now those 4 hours are
01:09:34.799 split up into four candlesticks so now
01:09:38.000 we're seeing even more detail so now
01:09:40.880 instead of just seeing one Candlestick
01:09:42.799 that represents 4 hours worth of price
01:09:44.799 action we are now seeing four
01:09:48.000 candlesticks one let me remove these
01:09:51.000 drawings 1 2 3 4 so these four
01:09:58.239 candlesticks in this gray box here
01:10:00.960 represent that 4-Hour Candlestick why
01:10:03.199 because now we're on the 1H hour time
01:10:04.719 frame so now each one of these
01:10:06.560 candlesticks shows one hour's worth of
01:10:09.199 price action so during this hour what
01:10:11.199 did price do well during this hour it
01:10:13.800 got to as low as $87,400
01:10:16.320 3 it
01:10:18.120 opened from the previous hours close at
01:10:23.080 87,4 120 at at some point in time during
01:10:26.679 those 60 Minutes during that hour price
01:10:29.040 got up to $
01:10:32.640 91,92 and by the time that hour
01:10:36.360 ended price closed at
01:10:41.960 $1,288 and then what happens the next
01:10:44.320 Candlestick opens and then it starts
01:10:46.560 forming so if we look at most recent
01:10:48.320 price action this Candlestick has how
01:10:50.679 long to
01:10:51.800 close 23 minutes and 35 5 Seconds where
01:10:56.640 has it been in the past hour it's been
01:10:59.400 up to
01:11:01.320 $94,200
01:11:02.880 where did it open at $ 93,587
01:11:25.520 and how price has moved within every
01:11:27.640 single minute we can even get down to
01:11:29.640 the second charts 15 seconds 30 seconds
01:11:32.760 we can get down to the 5 minutes so
01:11:35.520 now these candlesticks are showing five
01:11:38.800 minutes worth of price action okay so
01:11:42.480 now we can see that that previous
01:11:44.760 bullish 1hour candle in boom a whole
01:11:47.719 bunch of five minute candles so now
01:11:49.400 we're seeing okay boom there was two up
01:11:52.080 candles then two Down Candles then one
01:11:54.080 up candle then two down Down Candles
01:11:55.800 then two up candles then one down candle
01:11:57.840 okay we're able to see every single
01:12:01.719 detail of price movement using these
01:12:04.120 candlesticks and these candlesticks are
01:12:06.239 super super beneficial it paints a
01:12:08.320 picture and it tells us a story about
01:12:10.800 where price is going where price went
01:12:14.400 and how we can and how we can expect
01:12:16.400 price to react and move in the future
01:12:19.560 okay so that's that's candlesticks
01:12:22.560 explained again let's go back here we
01:12:25.320 have the open we have the close we have
01:12:28.320 the high we have the low Let Me Show an
01:12:30.920 example of a bearish Candlestick cuz we
01:12:33.159 didn't show any bearish ones but a down
01:12:35.440 candle again where did price open on
01:12:37.880 this down candle right here why do we
01:12:40.080 know that price opened right here
01:12:41.440 because it it closed down right so we
01:12:43.880 know if it closed down if it closed
01:12:46.199 bearish the open is going to be above
01:12:48.080 the close so it opened at this price at
01:12:55.239 5 minutes it got up to the price of
01:13:02.800 $94,800
01:13:05.120 476 and then at some point in time
01:13:07.280 during those 5 minutes price closed at
01:13:22.360 $93,500 now boom price action is is
01:13:25.199 being demonstrated in 15-minute candles
01:13:28.080 and I know this is super overwhelming
01:13:29.480 you're like what time frame do I look at
01:13:31.360 what do I what am I even doing on this
01:13:33.480 what's the difference between one day
01:13:35.480 worth of price action and one minute's
01:13:37.239 worth of price action all of that is
01:13:39.120 going to be explained don't worry again
01:13:41.679 my goal is to take you guys from
01:13:43.400 literally knowing nothing about trading
01:13:45.400 to giving you guys the highest leverage
01:13:47.320 skill in the world and this is just the
01:13:49.320 start and I know this is overwhelming
01:13:50.880 right now if you guys need to go back
01:13:52.320 and rewatch that like mini candlestick
01:13:55.199 Candlestick explained portion you guys
01:13:57.080 can go ahead feel free okay but we are
01:13:59.600 now going to be moving forward okay so
01:14:01.520 that was like candlesticks and time
01:14:02.880 frames explained okay so again these
01:14:05.120 time frames are essentially used to be
01:14:07.679 able to show how long and what time
01:14:11.440 frame we want the candles to be split up
01:14:14.760 in to see what price has done so again
01:14:18.239 if we want to see on a 15 minute so that
01:14:21.199 means we want to see
01:14:22.960 candlesticks that open in close and show
01:14:26.120 us price data from every 15 minutes we
01:14:29.679 would click on the 15minute time frame
01:14:31.440 so again this shows us 15 minutes worth
01:14:36.000 of price movement within each
01:14:37.920 Candlestick if we want to see just one
01:14:39.760 day's worth of price movement within
01:14:42.600 each Candlestick we would go to the
01:14:44.320 daily if we want to see just one week's
01:14:46.360 worth of price Movement we would click
01:14:48.639 on the weekly if we want to see one
01:14:50.400 month's worth of price movement and
01:14:54.080 obviously as we move higher and higher
01:14:57.560 throughout the time frames the candles
01:14:59.080 get bigger and bigger because right the
01:15:01.679 the price fluctuation across higher time
01:15:04.679 frames is going to be a lot larger and
01:15:06.600 then as we shrink down to maybe the 1
01:15:09.800 minute time frame the price fluctuations
01:15:12.239 are a lot smaller because one minute can
01:15:14.920 only do so much in terms of price right
01:15:17.840 so that's time frames and candlesticks
01:15:20.360 explain I don't want you guys to be
01:15:21.880 feeling overwhelmed right now I know
01:15:23.639 this is a whole bunch of information I
01:15:25.480 know when I was at your point in time I
01:15:27.400 was super freaking overwhelmed with all
01:15:30.480 of the information that was being thrown
01:15:31.800 at me just take it one bit at a time I
01:15:34.080 hope you guys are taking notes during
01:15:35.239 this because if you guys are that's
01:15:37.159 that's huge like the whole setting up
01:15:39.239 the software and everything like that's
01:15:40.520 easy that's just like a step byep but
01:15:41.960 this is actually like digesting the
01:15:43.560 information we got to give our our body
01:15:46.080 our brains time to digest this
01:15:48.880 information fully understand it and then
01:15:52.000 once we fully understand it we can move
01:15:53.560 on to the next concept so again I don't
01:15:55.520 want to rush you guys through this this
01:15:56.960 is a really long video and you guys are
01:15:58.480 going to if you guys just speedrun
01:16:00.320 throughout all this whole video you
01:16:02.800 probably won't be able to digest all
01:16:04.159 this information so like pause this
01:16:06.120 video rewatch that Candlestick that time
01:16:08.400 frame explained okay understand it and
01:16:11.679 then we can move on to the next subject
01:16:14.080 cool cool the next thing that we're
01:16:15.679 going to get into is the day trading
01:16:18.440 sessions so like I told you guys at the
01:16:20.560 start of this video if you guys are in
01:16:22.080 the UK if you guys are in down under in
01:16:24.520 Australia
01:16:25.520 or if you guys are in the United States
01:16:27.480 if you guys are in Africa if you guys
01:16:29.199 are in Egypt if you guys are in Asia
01:16:31.880 whatever there is a time to trade for
01:16:35.159 every single one of you guys and that's
01:16:36.920 one of the beauties of day trading is
01:16:39.320 there are three sessions okay so I'm
01:16:42.400 going to pull up a chart there's going
01:16:44.600 to be four sessions on there there's
01:16:46.000 technically Australian session but it's
01:16:48.280 pretty much Asian session okay but
01:16:50.760 there's three sessions there's Asian
01:16:52.880 session or Asian and Australian session
01:16:55.960 but everyone just calls it Asian session
01:16:57.960 London session and New York session and
01:17:00.880 those three sessions essentially
01:17:03.000 encapsulate the full 24 hours of the
01:17:07.159 market okay so from the day start to the
01:17:10.679 day end those three sessions encapsulate
01:17:13.840 the entire 24 hours of a day New York
01:17:16.679 session is only open for how like a
01:17:19.400 couple hours throughout the day London
01:17:20.880 session is only open for a couple hours
01:17:22.480 throughout the day and Asian session is
01:17:24.199 only open for for a couple hours
01:17:25.440 throughout the day I'm going to explain
01:17:26.800 the pros and cons to trading each
01:17:29.040 session what is going to be beneficial
01:17:30.760 for you guys as Traders depending on
01:17:32.679 your time zone and what is going to be
01:17:35.080 beneficial what pairs you guys might
01:17:38.040 want to trade during each session and so
01:17:41.600 again like if you guys decide like okay
01:17:43.560 for your time zone and the times that
01:17:45.320 you are able to trade it's going to be
01:17:47.560 London session there's going to be
01:17:49.040 certain pairs that move better that are
01:17:51.400 going to give you guys better setups
01:17:52.960 during London session then let's say New
01:17:55.360 York session if you guys say Okay I want
01:17:57.360 to trade during New York session there
01:17:59.400 are going to be pairs indexes
01:18:01.520 Commodities that just move better during
01:18:04.320 New York session compared to other pairs
01:18:07.159 that might not move at all during New
01:18:09.199 York session so I'm going to bring up a
01:18:11.040 very useful calendar this is on baby
01:18:14.199 Pips it's essentially just shows us the
01:18:18.440 overall session time zone so right now
01:18:21.480 it's a it's Sunday and we can see the
01:18:23.840 markets are closing for the weekend but
01:18:25.840 we can still just look so I set my time
01:18:28.639 zone to Eastern time that's how I have
01:18:31.920 my charts set so my charts are set to
01:18:34.280 Eastern time down here I see everything
01:18:36.840 in Eastern time we can see that down
01:18:38.880 here uh let me point to it mink right
01:18:42.440 there okay you can see the date and then
01:18:45.360 the time okay so where my hand is
01:18:48.840 hovering over right now boom it's
01:18:52.760 15 50 eastern time Sunday the 2nd of
01:18:58.159 March 2025 okay and then we can also
01:19:00.800 like we can go back in time all the way
01:19:02.960 back here so this was Friday February
01:19:06.560 28th like that's all the way down here
01:19:08.840 this Candlestick was whatever Friday
01:19:10.760 28th February of 2025 at 3:35 a.m.
01:19:15.400 eastern time okay so let's go back here
01:19:18.360 and let's see and understand the session
01:19:20.560 opens and closes so Asian session opens
01:19:23.800 at 7
01:19:25.600 p.m. eastern time okay there is a small
01:19:28.840 little Gap from when New York closes New
01:19:32.159 York closes at 5:00 p.m. eastern time
01:19:35.440 and then Asian session opens at 700 p.m.
01:19:39.199 eastern time okay so you guys might as
01:19:40.880 well write this down Asian session opens
01:19:43.880 at 7:00 p.m. eastern time and then it
01:19:46.520 closes at 4: a.m. eastern time okay
01:19:51.960 London session opens at 300 a.m. eastern
01:19:57.239 time and it closes at 12 p.m. eastern
01:20:04.320 time New York session opens at 8 a.m.
01:20:10.159 eastern time and closes at 5 p.m.
01:20:15.560 eastern time now again each one of these
01:20:18.440 sessions is going to have their own pros
01:20:20.560 and cons so I'm going to get into their
01:20:22.960 pros and cons right now nice thing about
01:20:24.880 website here is we can see okay like we
01:20:27.760 can see the trading volume and
01:20:29.760 volatility on depending on what session
01:20:32.679 you're going to be trading in now we can
01:20:34.199 see when we get over here towards Asian
01:20:37.239 session it's pretty low volume in
01:20:40.040 volatility so I don't want to tell you
01:20:43.000 guys what you can and can't do but I'm
01:20:46.000 telling you Asian session price does not
01:20:49.199 move well at all and it takes forever to
01:20:52.480 move and it's just because that session
01:20:54.719 there is little to no volume so I you
01:20:57.679 typically say never trade during Asian
01:21:00.320 session that's just my rule of thumb
01:21:02.840 never ever I don't care if you're
01:21:04.719 trading an Asian pair like if you're
01:21:06.639 trading J the USD JPY Market does not
01:21:10.320 move well during Asian session the only
01:21:12.280 two sessions that I would consider
01:21:14.000 trading would be London session and New
01:21:16.520 York session so London session opens at
01:21:20.719 300 a.m. eastern time so is that useful
01:21:24.199 for me
01:21:25.080 no cuz I'm not willing to wake up in the
01:21:27.440 middle of the night at 3:00 a.m. eastern
01:21:30.120 time to trade London session okay London
01:21:32.280 session we can see trading volume is
01:21:34.679 usually High during this during this
01:21:36.520 time of day all throughout London
01:21:38.040 session the trading volume is high so
01:21:40.199 that's awesome most of the time during
01:21:43.000 London session the best pairs to trade
01:21:45.600 are literally All Foreign Exchange Pairs
01:21:48.400 and commodities so that could be gold
01:21:52.000 that can be gbpusd that can be Euro USD
01:21:56.600 that can even be some off pairs like GBP
01:21:59.280 JPY I used to love trading that I I
01:22:01.880 actually used to trade London session
01:22:03.679 back in the day like I was telling you
01:22:05.000 guys about I would trade GBP JPY so the
01:22:07.840 pound against the Yen during London
01:22:09.880 session because it worked for me in my
01:22:11.880 time zone so again you just have to find
01:22:14.199 what what session open and what session
01:22:16.639 what session you want to be trading in
01:22:18.000 but this is this is pretty much like
01:22:19.480 setting your work hours so again if
01:22:22.320 you're like oh I'm always busy during
01:22:24.239 this time time but tjr likes trading
01:22:26.800 during during this time it's like no
01:22:28.320 we're not doing that you get to set your
01:22:30.080 own hours within trading so figure out
01:22:32.880 what session you are going to be trading
01:22:34.440 and those are your work hours for this
01:22:36.800 okay so London session opens at 3:00
01:22:39.040 a.m. and then New York session opens at
01:22:41.639 8:00 a.m. so for me New York session is
01:22:44.600 obviously way more optimal than 8: a.m.
01:22:47.440 is obviously way more optimal than 3:00
01:22:49.560 a.m. and luckily for me like during New
01:22:51.679 York session that's typically when
01:22:53.360 there's the most amount of volume
01:22:55.040 throughout the day which is which is
01:22:56.960 great for me cuz it's Boom the start of
01:22:58.960 my morning I wake up and I start trading
01:23:00.920 so again figure out what time zone
01:23:02.679 you're in what session is going to be
01:23:04.120 more favorable for you to trade in so
01:23:06.120 during New York session foreign exchange
01:23:08.440 markets they move well too I would like
01:23:10.920 to say that during London session the
01:23:13.520 Forex Market moves a little bit better
01:23:15.440 than New York session so if you say I
01:23:18.480 want to trade New York session I would
01:23:20.120 recommend you trade indexes which is
01:23:22.920 what I trade so that's going to trading
01:23:25.120 the NASDAQ that's going to be trading
01:23:27.280 the S&P 500 or just really any of those
01:23:30.560 us equities okay but if you guys to say
01:23:33.520 I want my trading hours to be during
01:23:35.120 London session cool you guys should
01:23:37.120 probably trade Commodities or Forex okay
01:23:40.000 so really any Forex pairs they move
01:23:42.400 really well during London session and
01:23:44.159 commodities something I want you guys to
01:23:45.800 keep in mind indexes if you guys want to
01:23:48.480 trade indexes they do not move well at
01:23:50.880 all during London session so again if
01:23:53.159 you want to trade us indexes because
01:23:55.239 they are us indexes they only operate on
01:23:59.600 New York Market open so on like a
01:24:02.679 Futures broker where you're only able to
01:24:04.679 trade us equities you won't be able to
01:24:07.360 trade those pairs once the US market
01:24:09.880 closes on like a cfd broke I we're
01:24:12.159 getting too deep into it but regardless
01:24:13.960 if you are if you want to trade like the
01:24:15.560 S&P 500 in NASDAQ you can only trade it
01:24:18.360 during New York session any other
01:24:19.840 session first of all either your broker
01:24:21.920 won't let you trade it or it's just not
01:24:24.080 a idea at all because there's no us
01:24:26.920 money being put into the markets and the
01:24:29.040 only way for price to move in index is
01:24:31.679 when US money is being put into the
01:24:33.159 markets okay so figure out what session
01:24:36.239 is good for you and then from there
01:24:38.280 we're going to hopefully explain like
01:24:40.960 how can we read these charts on top of
01:24:43.080 that what charts do we want to be
01:24:45.040 looking at because we don't want to be
01:24:46.440 looking at a billion different charts
01:24:48.360 okay I know I have a super long list
01:24:50.560 right here but I'm not trading every
01:24:52.960 single one of these okay at all the only
01:24:56.840 the only ones that I'm trading are these
01:24:58.840 two the S&P 500 and NASDAQ I'm only
01:25:01.520 looking at two charts on a daily basis
01:25:03.840 and I'm able to make a bunch of money so
01:25:05.280 what makes you think that you have to be
01:25:07.159 looking at 30 different and trust me I
01:25:09.360 have been there in your situation before
01:25:11.040 I've been in your situation and I've
01:25:12.840 added like 30 different Forex pairs
01:25:16.600 Commodities cryptos and indexes and I've
01:25:18.880 been looking at everyone at every single
01:25:20.520 one of them at one time trust me do not
01:25:22.920 do that I'm trying to save you from
01:25:24.719 mistakes that I made when I first
01:25:26.480 started that's what this whole video is
01:25:27.960 about to save you guys from mistakes
01:25:29.360 that I made when I first started and
01:25:30.800 hopefully put you guys on the right
01:25:32.080 track to being a profitable day trader
01:25:34.480 and I'm telling you right now make a new
01:25:36.600 watch list and only make it with one one
01:25:41.280 single pair that you want to look at so
01:25:43.159 if you say I want to trade during London
01:25:45.560 session awesome trade during London
01:25:48.600 session and trade like the pound against
01:25:51.080 the US dollar boom that's it just one
01:25:54.639 let's say you want to trade during New
01:25:56.719 York session awesome trade NASDAQ only
01:26:00.480 boom that's your one okay and you're
01:26:03.040 probably saying well then how come you
01:26:04.159 look at two how come you look at two huh
01:26:06.719 well because I'm better at this [ __ ]
01:26:08.840 than you and I've been doing it for
01:26:10.280 seven years Timmy when you when you be
01:26:13.280 when you can get that type of experience
01:26:15.440 then then you can start talking okay
01:26:17.400 buddy I'm just kidding but like I'm I'm
01:26:19.560 serious at the same time all right so
01:26:22.440 once we figured out what we want to
01:26:23.840 trade again let let me go over some of
01:26:26.280 the Forex pairs for you guys really
01:26:27.719 quick so just so you guys can get a good
01:26:30.360 feel Euro USD super good starter pair it
01:26:35.360 moves rather slow but that's good at the
01:26:39.320 start when you guys are just learning
01:26:40.800 this so Euro USD super good starter pair
01:26:43.840 GBP USD pound against the US dollar
01:26:47.199 another good starter pair if you want to
01:26:48.760 get a little bit frisky pound against
01:26:50.560 the Yen it's a little bit it's a little
01:26:52.400 bit faster moving it's a little bit more
01:26:54.040 vol volatile but it's also a good Forex
01:26:55.960 pair so again this is if you're trading
01:26:57.480 London session another fun one is
01:27:00.880 gold okay gold is a commodity and is
01:27:04.880 also a good pair to trade it's a little
01:27:07.119 bit more volatile it moves quickly
01:27:09.840 sometimes it's a little bit harder to
01:27:11.000 read and sometimes there's more fake
01:27:12.480 outs than others um and again we're
01:27:14.159 going to get into understanding the
01:27:15.960 charts and why they move and the fake
01:27:18.040 outs and all of this and all of that as
01:27:19.880 we go on in this video but I just want
01:27:21.560 to give you guys some options for like
01:27:22.960 certain pairs to look at so Euro USD is
01:27:25.440 good GBP USD is good GBP JPY we start
01:27:28.760 getting a little bit faster a little bit
01:27:30.320 more volatile gold we're definitely
01:27:32.400 getting faster we're definitely getting
01:27:33.719 more volatile and then if you want to
01:27:35.280 trade during New York session I would
01:27:37.080 look at either the S&P 500 or NASDAQ
01:27:40.520 okay now that we've established what
01:27:43.480 hours we're going to be trading and what
01:27:45.400 we are going to be trading and now that
01:27:47.480 we know candlesticks now that we know
01:27:50.520 time frames I think we can actually
01:27:53.080 start getting into
01:27:54.679 understanding why and how the chart
01:27:57.239 moves and how we're actually able to
01:27:59.560 capitalize and make money on these chart
01:28:02.400 movements cool all right so now we're
01:28:04.840 going to be getting into the Bare Basics
01:28:08.000 the absolute fundamentals when it comes
01:28:10.560 to understanding price action and price
01:28:13.520 movements within the day trading markets
01:28:16.159 and just within the markets themselves
01:28:17.800 so I know a lot of you guys when I was
01:28:20.560 probably going over the candlesticks you
01:28:22.199 were like well how do I how am I
01:28:24.480 supposed like yes this is a down candle
01:28:26.480 this is a down candle this is an up
01:28:27.840 candle but how am I supposed to figure
01:28:29.440 out where price is going to go don't
01:28:31.639 worry we are going to get to that and
01:28:33.639 after all of these things that I teach
01:28:35.199 you guys you guys will be very
01:28:36.600 sufficient in understanding where price
01:28:38.159 wants to go okay it will take some time
01:28:40.760 for you guys to get to that sufficiency
01:28:42.920 level but just know I'm going to give
01:28:44.880 you guys all the tools necessary in
01:28:46.719 order for you guys to succeed because
01:28:48.560 that's just that's just the type of guy
01:28:50.719 I am if I'm just being honest so the
01:28:53.159 first thing that we need to know how to
01:28:56.199 identify is highs and lows within the
01:28:59.600 market so you're probably saying well I
01:29:02.239 don't even know where to start on that
01:29:04.199 well I'll keep it simple for you guys
01:29:06.119 okay a high is a two Candlestick pattern
01:29:09.159 okay so you know those blue candles that
01:29:10.600 are on my chart it's a move up a blue
01:29:13.520 candle and Then followed by a black
01:29:15.920 candle and all you guys are going to do
01:29:18.360 is you're going to look at both of those
01:29:19.960 two candles and you're going to find the
01:29:21.800 tallest point or the highest Wick of the
01:29:24.239 two candles and that's a high I know
01:29:26.119 you're probably saying tjr how is this
01:29:28.040 going to be beneficial for me in the
01:29:30.159 long run trust me it will because it's
01:29:32.800 one of the most important Concepts I
01:29:34.840 know this seems super Elementary but it
01:29:36.560 is one of the most important Concepts
01:29:38.040 that you are going to learn so
01:29:39.440 understanding this now is going to
01:29:41.000 benefit you huge later next a low it's
01:29:44.840 the exact opposite okay a move down
01:29:47.320 followed by a move up okay and then you
01:29:49.639 take the lowest point of those two
01:29:51.440 candles so again a high
01:29:54.639 is a move up then a move down so a blue
01:29:57.920 candle then a Black Candle let's do a
01:30:00.840 little test is a high a move up then a
01:30:03.719 move
01:30:04.520 up no idiot it is not a high is a move
01:30:09.840 up then a move down is a low a move down
01:30:13.360 then a move down you'd be surprised I
01:30:15.080 know you're probably saying well yeah
01:30:16.560 obviously it's not you would be
01:30:18.440 surprised at you would be surprised
01:30:21.000 that's all I'm going to say it's a move
01:30:22.679 down then a move up in the lowest point
01:30:24.320 of those two candles cool let's go into
01:30:26.600 the chart and work on identifying them
01:30:29.080 so where are the
01:30:31.360 highs oh yeah see now it gets a little
01:30:33.920 bit scarier now that we're looking at
01:30:35.800 all of this mumbo jumbo gets a little
01:30:38.080 bit scarier so what we're going to do is
01:30:39.840 we're literally just going to walk
01:30:41.239 through this and we're just going to
01:30:42.239 label highs and lows what's a low a move
01:30:44.960 down then a move up so where do we have
01:30:47.239 lows well this is a move down then this
01:30:49.280 is a move up cool where's the lowest
01:30:51.880 point of those two candles right here

01:31:35.679 Chomp down on it that is not a high a
01:31:40.080 high is a move up then a move down so
01:31:45.080 where is the high move up then a move
01:31:46.719 down the highest point of those two
01:31:47.880 candles move down then move up the
01:31:49.520 lowest point of those two candles boom
01:31:51.840 are we getting the feel are we getting
01:31:53.239 into
01:31:57.960 okay are we getting into the flow of

01:32:02.440 just me move down then move up boom low
01:32:06.280 move up then move down boom High okay
01:32:08.920 now let me show you an exam a better
01:32:11.000 example of what's not a high and what's
01:32:13.040 not a low because again some people they
01:32:15.760 be they be on that dumb [ __ ] right here
01:32:18.960 we have a low right where is
01:32:21.600 it okay um
01:32:24.520 you Timmy uh where is the low
01:32:28.360 Timmy well it's at the lowest point of
01:32:30.679 those candles s Quicks a clap it up for
01:32:33.920 Timmy he got it
01:32:35.600 right
01:32:37.199 Timmy you
01:32:39.360 little
01:32:41.119 [ __ ] don't make me spank you on the
01:32:44.960 bottom of your ass with a full stack of
01:32:48.440 books that is not a [ __ ] low where is
01:32:53.000 the low this is black than black that's
01:32:57.199 not an interracial that's not an
01:32:59.119 interracial marriage we need a black and
01:33:02.320 a blue or a black and a white maybe
01:33:05.440 light skin type [ __ ] okay we need black
01:33:08.480 than blue black than blue lowest point
01:33:10.520 of those two candles where is the low
01:33:12.520 boom this is the low it's not this why
01:33:17.040 one black two black three black four
01:33:20.000 black that's like we're not [ __ ] with
01:33:23.080 all of that
01:33:24.280 okay we need black then blue that's the
01:33:27.400 low okay let's show a good example of
01:33:30.199 the opposite and we actually have it
01:33:31.639 right here where is the high right
01:33:35.360 here is it this because it's the highest
01:33:37.960 point
01:33:39.520 no why cuz move down then a move down
01:33:42.880 it's not a [ __ ] high move up then a
01:33:45.400 move down this is a
01:33:48.480 high we good good now that we understand
01:33:51.840 highs and lows guys you guys are doing
01:33:55.440 good you guys are doing good you guys
01:33:57.560 just have like another five more hours
01:34:00.360 and then two years of struggling until
01:34:04.320 you turn I'm kidding I'm kidding but low
01:34:07.199 key though you guys do have some more
01:34:08.679 work to put in because it's not as
01:34:10.000 simple as just highs and lows because
01:34:11.639 again let me ask you where do you think
01:34:13.000 this chart is
01:34:14.840 going I can tell you right now where
01:34:17.000 this chart is going but I can promise
01:34:19.199 you you right now with the information
01:34:21.000 that I've given you so far you ain't got
01:34:23.080 [ __ ] so we keep plowing through and I'm
01:34:25.639 going to keep plowing through for you
01:34:27.159 guys next thing that we need to
01:34:28.880 understand is
01:34:30.159 Trends how does the market even move
01:34:32.880 okay so put let's put a pin in
01:34:35.280 identifying highs and lows in the market
01:34:37.440 also also also pause pause pause pause
01:34:39.400 pause before we get into this go on your
01:34:42.280 own on trading view Mark out five highs
01:34:47.119 and five lows just to re like cuz again
01:34:50.880 there's one thing of you just watching
01:34:52.400 this video and then there's another
01:34:53.440 thing of you guys taking action I need
01:34:55.000 you guys consistently taking action with
01:34:56.880 this video in order for you guys to
01:34:58.400 fully digest this because if you guys
01:35:00.040 just sit and watch and you're like in
01:35:01.440 your popcor man the tjr guys kind of
01:35:03.440 [ __ ] funny I think I'm going to learn
01:35:05.239 how to no bro no it's not going to work
01:35:08.880 okay so what I need you guys to do go
01:35:11.440 ahead Mark out five highs and five lows
01:35:14.440 done awesome now we can get into how
01:35:17.960 does the market move the market moves in
01:35:19.760 three different ways it goes up it goes
01:35:23.040 down and then it goes
01:35:25.679 sideways so we need to be able to
01:35:28.400 identify when the market is going up
01:35:31.000 when the market is going down and be
01:35:33.400 able to identify when the Market's going
01:35:35.119 sideways so this is going to be
01:35:37.639 introducing Trends okay and Market
01:35:40.920 structure so to keep things simple when
01:35:44.159 the market goes up does it just go up
01:35:46.920 like this forever no even Bitcoin
01:35:50.199 doesn't even do that okay when the
01:35:52.320 market goes down does it just go down
01:35:54.679 like this and down forever no even meme
01:35:57.800 coins don't do that okay and then also
01:36:01.679 consolidation or sideways movement so
01:36:04.800 when price moves
01:36:06.679 up how does it move up get very familiar
01:36:10.320 with this terminology it moves up in
01:36:12.800 higher highs and higher lows so remember
01:36:16.320 we're taking the pin out of the highs
01:36:17.760 and lows now and we're plopping it back
01:36:20.400 in here highs and lows okay so how do we
01:36:24.159 identify it okay when the Market's
01:36:27.639 moving up it moves in what higher highs
01:36:29.520 and higher lows so if we have a high
01:36:31.199 right here and then a low right here and
01:36:33.199 we're in an uptrend and Market's moving
01:36:35.040 up what is market going to do it's going
01:36:37.600 to do what make a higher high than the
01:36:40.080 previous high that it made and it's
01:36:41.600 going to make a higher low than the
01:36:43.440 previous low that it made and then it's
01:36:45.320 going to make a higher high than the
01:36:46.880 previous high that it made and then it's
01:36:48.239 going to make a higher low than the
01:36:49.760 previous low that I made and then it's
01:36:51.440 just going to keep going like this cool
01:36:54.560 so before we show downtrends let's show
01:36:58.400 examples of this we've had pretty pretty
01:37:01.800 brutal price action the past couple
01:37:04.760 weeks and months so I want to find a
01:37:06.719 good example of this th this is kind of
01:37:08.560 like the start of a good example
01:37:10.360 here okay where's our low right here
01:37:14.520 where's our high right here okay high
01:37:18.600 low price pushes past this High then
01:37:20.800 does what we have a higher high and then
01:37:24.199 we have a higher low and then what
01:37:26.400 happens we have a higher high move up
01:37:28.679 then it move down then we have a higher
01:37:30.000 low move down then it move up then we
01:37:32.320 have a higher high move up then it move
01:37:34.320 down then we have a higher low move down
01:37:36.719 then it move up all the way until boom
01:37:38.960 structure gets broken on this move down
01:37:42.000 so uptrends how do they move in higher
01:37:45.960 highs and higher lows Flow State Flow
01:37:48.599 State Baby Boom so when we're making
01:37:50.880 higher highs and higher lows what are we
01:37:52.560 expecting the market to do to continue
01:37:54.440 the trend the trend is your friend get
01:37:56.199 very familiar with that as well the
01:37:57.679 trend is your friend in this market
01:37:59.679 because if the market is trending up
01:38:01.560 what are you probably going to want to
01:38:02.639 do press buy if the Market's trending
01:38:04.679 down what are you going to probably want
01:38:06.159 to do press sell but before you guys log
01:38:08.560 into your brokerage and put $1,000
01:38:10.360 billion dollar on what I just taught you
01:38:13.040 we need to learn way more because it's a
01:38:15.360 lot more than just higher highs and
01:38:16.840 higher lows and blah blah blah and we're
01:38:18.800 going to be
01:38:19.840 billionaires okay it's a lot more than
01:38:22.159 that now downtrend what is it it's the
01:38:25.520 exact
01:38:26.639 opposite so when the market is going
01:38:29.239 down what is it doing it's making lower
01:38:32.599 highs and lower lows so it follows that
01:38:36.119 same Flow State
01:38:38.199 movement and follows that same Trend
01:38:41.000 where we have a high a low lower high
01:38:43.639 lower low lower high lower low lower
01:38:46.000 high lower low lower high lower low
01:38:47.719 lower high lower low and boom that's how
01:38:50.800 a downtrend is formed plain and simple
01:38:52.880 let's go ahead
01:38:54.000 and let's identify it on the market
01:38:56.320 because on the S&P 500 it's kind of like
01:38:59.080 an up only type of index so it's kind of
01:39:01.719 hard to find downtrends there's like
01:39:04.440 mini downtrends here this is fine ready
01:39:07.719 this mini downtrend within the uptrend
01:39:10.280 is fine we have a high right here
01:39:13.400 right we have a low we have a high right
01:39:17.159 here we have a low we have a high right
01:39:20.280 here and then we have a low
01:39:23.480 high low lower high lower low lower high
01:39:27.239 lower low before the trend reverses and
01:39:30.639 I'm going to teach you guys how to one
01:39:32.960 be able to identify these reversals two
01:39:35.360 be able to trade these reversals and
01:39:38.400 three be ahead of the game so that you
01:39:40.199 guys don't get caught up and lose trades
01:39:42.599 on these reversals when you're trying to
01:39:44.040 trade within the trend got it got it but
01:39:46.599 for the time being I want you guys to
01:39:49.880 pause this video go to trading view boom
01:39:52.840 go ahead and Mark out just go and
01:39:55.599 identify and it doesn't matter what time
01:39:57.599 frame okay you can be on the weekly the
01:39:59.199 daily whatever that's that's something
01:40:00.840 else that you guys need to know and
01:40:02.520 understand every single thing that I'm
01:40:04.000 teaching you guys on here is applicable
01:40:06.880 to every single time frame so that's the
01:40:09.800 cool thing about the market this is on
01:40:11.320 the weekly time frame right each one of
01:40:12.840 these candles is a week's worth of price
01:40:14.679 action not not only are there high are
01:40:17.159 there highs lows lower highs and lower
01:40:18.880 lows on the weekly time frame but when
01:40:20.760 we go down to the 5 minute time frame is
01:40:23.040 this structure the same for identifying
01:40:25.440 down Trends and uptrends yes it's the
01:40:27.239 exact same Let's uh let's find an
01:40:29.400 example here this is a good example
01:40:33.000 look
01:40:35.040 high
01:40:37.599 low lower
01:40:40.440 high lower low lower
01:40:45.440 high lower
01:40:47.599 low lower
01:40:50.000 high lower low
01:40:53.360 lower
01:40:55.159 high lower low lower low until what the
01:41:00.679 trend
01:41:01.440 reverses so that's the cool thing about
01:41:03.520 these Trends and that's the cool thing
01:41:04.960 about all of these tools and strategies
01:41:09.440 that I'm going to show you guys in this
01:41:10.639 video they are applicable to every
01:41:13.560 single time frame these Trends happen on
01:41:16.800 every single time frame the way that the
01:41:18.639 market moves it moves the same on every
01:41:21.760 single time frame so once you know how
01:41:24.480 to trade you that's why I'm telling you
01:41:27.560 trading is literally the highest
01:41:28.960 leverage skill in the world bro because
01:41:31.400 once you learn how to day trade you are
01:41:33.920 able to predict price in Market
01:41:36.400 movements on every scale on the weekly
01:41:40.239 level on the monthly level you'll know
01:41:42.159 where price is going to go within the
01:41:44.080 next 5 minutes like it's so powerful the
01:41:46.719 skill of day trading and that's why I'm
01:41:48.080 so passionate about this [ __ ] because I
01:41:50.199 know what it did for my life and I know
01:41:51.520 what it can do for yours and that's why
01:41:52.880 I'm making this this video for you guys
01:41:54.679 so continuing we know what to look for
01:41:57.560 when the Market's moving up we now know
01:41:59.960 what to look for when the Market's
01:42:00.960 moving down what happens when the
01:42:02.159 Market's moving
01:42:03.480 sideways that's called
01:42:06.199 consolidation and typically the market
01:42:09.360 will just be looking like
01:42:12.920 this okay it won't have any sort of
01:42:15.440 trend it won't have any sort of
01:42:17.480 direction there's no higher highs
01:42:19.639 there's no higher lows it's just it's
01:42:21.760 it's making AB like random highs lows
01:42:24.360 whatever and it's just moving sideways
01:42:26.639 so perfect example of that is literally
01:42:30.400 what we're in right now on the daily
01:42:32.560 time frame so if we just look at this
01:42:34.800 most of the time I'm I I show and
01:42:36.960 demonstrate consolidation just by a big
01:42:38.800 rectangle why because this isn't a
01:42:41.520 trending Market this Market is moving
01:42:44.000 sideways so we can see we have a high
01:42:46.599 that a low then a lower high then a
01:42:48.920 higher low then a lower high but then a
01:42:51.719 lower low but then a low lower high and
01:42:54.239 then a higher low and then a higher high
01:42:57.000 then a higher low but oh wait now that's
01:42:58.880 a lower low and then a higher
01:43:01.800 low and then a higher high and then a
01:43:04.920 lower low see it doesn't this is not a
01:43:07.920 trending Market this is a sideways
01:43:10.440 Market but luckily there are ways to
01:43:13.119 trade this and I'm going to teach you
01:43:14.480 guys how to trade it again now that you
01:43:16.679 guys know how to identify consolidation
01:43:18.639 go ahead and do that and again just like
01:43:21.360 moving up and moving down this is a
01:43:23.119 applicable on every single time frame so
01:43:25.239 this is like literally the past couple
01:43:28.119 months on this because each Candlestick
01:43:30.599 represents a day in the market right now
01:43:33.440 cuz I'm on the daily time frame bro like
01:43:35.560 this has been we have been in this
01:43:38.080 little consolidation range for the past
01:43:41.599 couple months but we can even scale we
01:43:44.760 can scale down to lower time frames and
01:43:46.719 we can find consolidation there as well
01:43:49.199 so like look right here look at this the
01:43:51.599 market is just just freaking moving
01:43:53.800 sideways high low blah blah blah blah
01:43:56.080 blah blah it just looks disgusting until
01:43:58.480 the market finally breaks out and then
01:44:00.199 what happens it starts trending down
01:44:02.599 makes a high then a low lower high lower
01:44:05.080 low lower high lower low okay so we need
01:44:09.119 to be able to identify not only
01:44:10.480 downtrends and uptrends but also
01:44:12.239 consolidation cool once we have that we
01:44:15.719 are ready to move on to the next subject
01:44:19.239 so now that we know how to identify
01:44:21.360 Trends now that we know how to ident
01:44:23.400 highs and lows we're on to our very
01:44:26.280 first concept and our very first
01:44:28.719 Confluence that is going to be extremely
01:44:31.679 beneficial for you guys in trading which
01:44:33.960 is called Break of structure so I'm
01:44:36.880 going to break down every single one so
01:44:39.480 first of all I know I'm using big words
01:44:41.840 but at the end of the day I like I told
01:44:43.800 you guys before I'm like actually on the
01:44:45.560 Spectrum so I'm just like a nerd with
01:44:47.400 the trading [ __ ] so I prefer to call
01:44:49.239 things their correct names but
01:44:51.800 Confluence is pretty much just like uh
01:44:54.679 it's like a reasoning to get into a
01:44:57.280 trade or like it's a reasoning for why
01:44:59.599 price moves so most of the time you say
01:45:02.800 like oh yeah what were your confluences
01:45:05.880 to enter into a trade like what were the
01:45:08.679 reasons for why you entered into a trade
01:45:10.920 and you say like oh there was a break of
01:45:12.520 structure and there was an imbalance of
01:45:15.119 price here and price came in and it
01:45:17.080 filled it blah blah blah blah blah bank
01:45:19.320 roll so we are going to cover break of
01:45:22.119 structure first this is a Confluence
01:45:25.040 okay that is very useful for us and it
01:45:28.080 is kind of one of the first steps of
01:45:30.360 understanding price movement so break of
01:45:35.360 structure you often see people um
01:45:39.000 abbreviated as just B okay boss man Dow
01:45:44.000 all right so what is break of structure
01:45:45.719 so you guys just learned about Trends
01:45:47.760 right you guys know what a trend is
01:45:49.320 break of structure is essentially when
01:45:52.000 the structure the trend breaks okay so
01:45:56.080 when the current Trend gets dis
01:46:02.040 respected that's all it is when the
01:46:03.840 current Trend gets disrespected now how
01:46:06.560 do we identify it I'm going to put this
01:46:09.080 as simple as possible break structure is
01:46:11.440 one of the easiest confluences to
01:46:13.320 understand so hopefully you guys get it
01:46:14.560 and also guys get [ __ ] excited this
01:46:16.400 is like our first like real deal real
01:46:18.800 Spiel like get [ __ ] excited this is
01:46:21.560 our first thing that we can actually
01:46:23.480 like start [ __ ] applying and getting
01:46:27.040 like my eyes are lightened up I feel
01:46:28.840 like I'm on [ __ ] Molly and cocaine
01:46:31.000 right now and I'm just
01:46:34.119 like I'm just so fired up to teach you
01:46:37.119 guys this [ __ ] so please be as fired up
01:46:40.159 as me and take some [ __ ] notes break
01:46:42.400 of structure it's when the trend current
01:46:44.440 Trend gets disrespected okay if we're in
01:46:46.960 an
01:46:48.639 uptrend higher highs and higher
01:46:51.480 lows how would we hypothetically break
01:46:55.159 this trend how would we disrespect this
01:46:57.320 trend well we would just quite simply
01:46:59.320 stop making higher highs and higher lows
01:47:01.400 right so in order for us to no longer
01:47:05.159 have higher highs and higher lows what
01:47:06.800 has to happen we have to
01:47:11.560 make a lower
01:47:13.960 low right and a potential lower
01:47:18.040 high now a break of structure to the
01:47:21.639 downside which which is what I just
01:47:23.520 marked out is when we are in an uptrend
01:47:27.000 and the most recent low make sure you
01:47:30.080 take notes of this because this is
01:47:31.360 important as much as I love messing
01:47:33.440 around okay I want you guys to be
01:47:35.840 successful a break of structure to the
01:47:38.199 downtrend the to the downside is when we
01:47:41.000 are in an uptrend and the most recent
01:47:45.080 low emphasis on most recent one the most
01:47:47.639 recent low that was created gets closed
01:47:51.400 underneath by a a candle okay and we are
01:47:54.440 going to show examples of this but a
01:47:56.440 break of structure to the downside is
01:47:58.239 when we are in an uptrend currently
01:48:00.320 making higher highs and higher lows and
01:48:02.960 we get a candle closure so in our case
01:48:06.880 and on my chart it would have to be a
01:48:08.800 big
01:48:10.239 girthy wide
01:48:12.679 Black
01:48:14.360 Candle you thought candle that closes
01:48:18.199 underneath the low okay and that's how
01:48:20.960 we can identify a break of structure to
01:48:22.520 the downside now break of structure to
01:48:24.560 the upside what is it well it's when we
01:48:27.719 are in a
01:48:29.760 downtrend so making lower lows and lower
01:48:32.159 highs now how do we break a
01:48:36.280 downtrend simple we
01:48:38.960 make a higher high instead of another
01:48:41.920 lower high Boom the trend is broken off
01:48:44.560 of this how do we officially break
01:48:47.440 structure on this when we get a big wide
01:48:52.360 long long
01:48:55.719 lanky in my case blue Candlestick
01:48:58.840 closure over what the most recent high
01:49:02.520 so how do we break structure to the
01:49:04.480 upside when we are in a downtrend we get
01:49:09.159 a candle closure above the most recent
01:49:13.920 High okay the most recent high that was
01:49:16.000 made within the trend we get a candle
01:49:17.800 closure above
01:49:19.360 it that's how we identify break of
01:49:22.760 structure so now that you guys know how
01:49:24.960 to identify break of structure at least
01:49:27.119 on my Picasso drawings and on lines
01:49:29.639 let's actually get into the difficult
01:49:32.119 part which is actually identifying it on
01:49:34.679 the chart so there are two things that I
01:49:37.320 want you guys to pay attention to when
01:49:38.719 we go onto the chart the first thing
01:49:40.639 that you guys need to do is Boom
01:49:42.760 immediately identify the current Trend
01:49:45.280 that we are in so you got we already
01:49:46.719 taught you guys how to do that right
01:49:48.520 we're just looking for higher highs and
01:49:50.000 higher lows okay cool once we do that
01:49:53.360 what are we going to be looking for
01:49:55.080 we're going to be looking for breaks of
01:49:56.599 structure okay so see when that current
01:49:58.960 Trend that we are in gets disrespected
01:50:01.159 okay so those are the two things that I
01:50:02.400 want you guys to look out for when we
01:50:04.440 get into this okay tell me what you
01:50:07.960 see yeah it's a lot hard it's a lot
01:50:10.599 harder when we when we pull up the
01:50:12.520 charts and we got Candlestick Wicks
01:50:14.280 everywhere and we don't know what what
01:50:16.000 price is doing don't worry I'm going to
01:50:17.480 break down pretty much all of this for
01:50:19.679 you okay so this this is actually a
01:50:23.159 really good example that we have right
01:50:24.440 here we'll just go ahead and start here
01:50:26.280 we'll we'll start within this area okay
01:50:29.280 we have a
01:50:30.639 low then we have a high move up then a
01:50:33.360 move down the highest point of those two
01:50:34.719 candles following that what happens this
01:50:37.360 candle closes Above This High cool so
01:50:41.719 prior to this we were in a downtrend why
01:50:44.480 high low lower high lower low lower high
01:50:47.719 lower low okay and then after that lower
01:50:50.880 high and lower low got made what did we
01:50:52.480 do do we broke structure to the upside
01:50:54.360 how because we
01:50:57.239 closed above the most recent high that
01:51:01.040 was made in the
01:51:02.960 downtrend I know it's confusing but stay
01:51:05.880 with me now now what trend are we in
01:51:08.199 after we break structure on this candle
01:51:09.960 because we closed above the most recent
01:51:11.679 High something I want you something I
01:51:13.520 want you guys to also notice look so we
01:51:15.639 have a high right here right and then a
01:51:17.840 new high gets formed right here does
01:51:19.960 this High get broken above when this
01:51:22.239 comes up and gets me no so what do we
01:51:24.639 have to classify as the new high now
01:51:26.400 right here whenever we're waiting for a
01:51:28.320 break of structure to the upside we're
01:51:31.239 just constantly monitoring highs
01:51:33.679 whenever we're waiting for a break of
01:51:34.920 structure to the downside what are we
01:51:36.239 doing we're just constantly monitoring
01:51:38.280 the new lows that get made so in this
01:51:40.040 case we're looking for a break of
01:51:41.119 structure to the upside why cuz we're in
01:51:43.560 a current downtrend and how do we look
01:51:46.560 and wait for a break of structure to the
01:51:48.400 upside we just monitor the most recent
01:51:50.239 highs that get made so this was the most
01:51:51.679 recent high that got made and then boom
01:51:53.280 we break structure so now we're in an
01:51:54.840 uptrend and we can see that why we have
01:51:56.880 a high this low is a higher low compared
01:52:00.159 to this one and then boom we go up and
01:52:02.400 we
01:52:03.159 make a higher high now this is where it
01:52:07.400 gets tricky and this is where it's going
01:52:08.719 to get very confusing for some of you
01:52:10.440 guys see this Candlestick right
01:52:12.800 here we have a low right here and a low
01:52:16.119 right here but this low this move down
01:52:17.880 then it move up goes
01:52:20.480 underneath both of the these
01:52:23.639 lows is this a break of structure no and
01:52:28.639 I know that is very hard for your brain
01:52:30.880 to contemplate right now because you're
01:52:32.840 like wait but there was a high and then
01:52:36.119 this went underneath two lows it made a
01:52:38.119 lower low yes you're right it did make a
01:52:40.639 lower low but how do we identify a break
01:52:44.719 of
01:52:46.320 structure and in this case right now
01:52:49.280 that we're in an uptrend we're looking
01:52:50.599 for breaks of structure to the downside
01:52:52.639 what do we need we need this low because
01:52:55.480 this is the most recent low we actually
01:52:57.119 don't care about this one this is the
01:52:58.920 most recent low what do we need to
01:53:00.480 happen to this low we need this to be a
01:53:02.199 full Candlestick we need this to be a
01:53:04.119 full Candlestick we need a candle
01:53:06.440 closure so look see the difference
01:53:08.880 between this High what did this candle
01:53:11.440 do to it it closed above it the candle
01:53:14.840 close is above this High did this candle
01:53:18.400 right here break structure no because it
01:53:20.079 was only a wick above the high but this
01:53:22.199 candle it closed above so when we look
01:53:25.800 at this right here this Candlestick
01:53:27.920 where's the most recent low what is our
01:53:30.239 current Trend we're currently in an
01:53:33.159 uptrend for us to break structure to the
01:53:35.480 downside we would need this candle
01:53:37.880 closure to be underneath this low so for
01:53:41.159 that reason we are still in an
01:53:44.679 uptrend and price respects that and goes
01:53:48.320 and makes a new higher high and then
01:53:52.079 look what happens again now this is the
01:53:55.320 most recent
01:53:56.920 low even though we technically did make
01:53:59.760 a lower low we are still in an uptrend
01:54:03.159 because we haven't broken structure yet
01:54:05.159 and look what price does again price
01:54:07.360 goes down do we get a closure underneath
01:54:10.000 the most recent low within the we are
01:54:12.360 still in an uptrend because we haven't
01:54:13.960 broken structure to the downside yet no
01:54:16.199 we do not break structure to the
01:54:17.560 downside and then where does price
01:54:19.880 go it rips up
01:54:22.960 I know that was very confusing but I
01:54:24.800 needed to show you guys those examples
01:54:27.119 of no breaks of structure so again if
01:54:30.560 we're in an uptrend and this is our most
01:54:33.000 recent low and we see a Candlestick Wick
01:54:35.400 go underneath this most recent low is
01:54:38.079 that a break of structure no it is not
01:54:41.560 okay it is not a break of structure to
01:54:43.239 the downside the only time that it's a
01:54:45.079 break of structure to the downside is
01:54:46.760 when we get a candle closure underneath
01:54:49.040 the most recent low so let's Show an
01:54:50.719 example of breaking structure to the
01:54:52.040 downside now within this we are in in an
01:54:54.520 uptrend why and how do we know that well
01:54:56.920 it's just it's [ __ ] going up okay I
01:54:58.800 mean I I could Mark out the highs and
01:55:00.119 lows if we needed to look move up then
01:55:03.320 then move down high move down then move
01:55:05.639 up low higher high higher low higher
01:55:07.880 high can't cool this is actually another
01:55:09.639 good example of this actually look we
01:55:11.719 can see this Candlestick boom it
01:55:14.000 actually goes underneath this low but it
01:55:15.480 doesn't close underneath it and then
01:55:16.800 what happens price
01:55:18.079 maintains that uptrend it actually goes
01:55:20.560 up and to create a higher high so now
01:55:22.360 where's the most recent low that we're
01:55:24.480 looking for in this uptrend to get
01:55:26.280 broken this is the most recent low where
01:55:28.679 do we break structure I want you pause
01:55:30.679 this video look at it where do we end up
01:55:33.199 breaking structure to the downside what
01:55:34.760 Candlestick we break structure to the
01:55:36.360 downside on this candle right here why
01:55:39.280 because look at the candle close this
01:55:41.239 candle closes underneath the most recent
01:55:45.199 low that was made within an uptrend so
01:55:47.400 now what are we in after we get a candle
01:55:49.280 closure underneath this low we are in a
01:55:51.880 Down Trend so now we have a high now we
01:55:54.880 have a lower low now we have a lower
01:55:57.119 high now we are literally forming as we
01:55:59.880 speak a lower low now that you guys know
01:56:04.159 how to identify brakes of structure this
01:56:06.480 isn't the magic pill this is not going
01:56:08.480 to turn you into a profitable Trader but
01:56:11.440 now that we know how to identify Trends
01:56:13.840 and now that we know how to identify
01:56:15.639 highs and lows and now that we know how
01:56:17.840 to identify breakes of structure we are
01:56:19.880 in an insanely
01:56:22.400 good spot and get [ __ ] ready because
01:56:28.079 in yeah literally in like the next
01:56:30.199 couple minutes you guys are going to
01:56:31.280 learn [ __ ] that's going to blow your
01:56:32.560 [ __ ] mind and honestly it blew my
01:56:34.880 mind when I learned about it or when I
01:56:36.760 discovered it on the charts and I am
01:56:39.400 going to help you guys blow your or I'm
01:56:43.320 going to try and blow you guys I I want
01:56:46.159 to blow you guys and blow your guys'
01:56:49.800 minds so let's let's go do do that
01:56:54.360 okay see I see I did that I did that I
01:56:58.199 blew you got get it I told you I was
01:57:01.079 going okay all right let's learn about
01:57:03.199 liquidity this is by far the most
01:57:05.679 important
01:57:06.920 concept oh like this is the goat of
01:57:10.800 Concepts the greatest of all time of
01:57:12.840 Concepts and then the concept following
01:57:14.920 this this is like Michael Jordan versus
01:57:17.840 LeBron debate liquidity is LeBron and
01:57:20.440 then fair value gaps and imbalances is
01:57:22.480 like Michael Jordan why cuz liquidity is
01:57:24.679 better than fair value gaps and
01:57:26.199 imbalances LeBron is better than Jordan
01:57:28.800 but before we get all the old heads
01:57:32.000 riled up MJ was better let me just teach
01:57:34.320 you guys how to trade this [ __ ] first
01:57:36.560 okay so what even is
01:57:39.119 liquidity liquidity is pending orders or
01:57:43.599 okay we'll do this for the retards just
01:57:46.679 resting orders above highs and Below
01:57:51.280 lows
01:57:52.800 that's all it is that's all liquidity is
01:57:55.560 liquidity is resting orders above highs
01:57:58.040 and Below lows and you're probably
01:58:00.000 thinking hey I know what a highend low
01:58:02.480 is that's right Timmy you do know what a
01:58:04.400 highend low is so you know where
01:58:06.599 liquidity is liquidity is above highs
01:58:09.960 and Below lows consistently without a
01:58:12.560 doubt every single time liquidity is
01:58:15.560 above highs and Below lows so if there's
01:58:17.440 a high in the market what is there above
01:58:19.440 it liquidity if there's a low in the
01:58:22.239 Market what's there below it liquidity
01:58:24.960 more importantly resting orders now when
01:58:28.599 I explain liquidity I like to explain it
01:58:30.520 like
01:58:31.520 this we as retail Traders so first of
01:58:34.880 all if you guys don't know how the
01:58:36.280 market moves okay the market moves off
01:58:39.880 of just off of market makers not us so
01:58:43.000 we are retail Traders we are making the
01:58:46.960 tiniest smallest
01:58:49.440 transactions compared to funds and the
01:58:52.960 people that are actually moving the
01:58:54.440 market okay so that keep that in mind
01:58:57.679 okay so the people that are moving the
01:58:59.079 market the market moves based off of
01:59:00.599 algorithms and algorithms in order for
01:59:03.560 them to fulfill orders they need orders
01:59:05.760 to go in the other other direction okay
01:59:07.599 so just like how I explained in that
01:59:10.119 whatever that little Ecom class example
01:59:12.320 of buying the share of Apple stock right
01:59:15.360 if I want to buy a share of the S&P 500
01:59:19.520 or if I want to buy a share of the
01:59:21.000 NASDAQ somebody has has to be willing to
01:59:22.760 sell it to me this is equally true at
01:59:26.800 scale so let's say I want to buy 1
01:59:29.920 billion worth of S&P 500 or $1 billion
01:59:34.040 do worth of S&P shares let's say I want
01:59:37.719 to buy a billion dollars worth of NASDAQ
01:59:41.239 shares okay somebody has to be willing
01:59:43.440 to sell that to me so again how did how
01:59:47.400 do these transactions take place well I
01:59:49.880 know this is kind of going to be
01:59:51.079 counteractive to what I just taught you
01:59:53.280 about uptrends and downtrends but just
01:59:55.840 bear with me for
01:59:57.639 now just like how I taught you guys that
02:00:00.520 when we're in an uptrend we make higher
02:00:02.520 highs and higher lows okay market makers
02:00:05.040 know that in a downtrend we make lower
02:00:07.719 lows and lower highs so when we move P
02:00:10.000 when we're in a downtrend and we move
02:00:11.639 past a low what's what's going to be
02:00:13.760 expected we're expected to go lower
02:00:16.000 right and then what's going to happen
02:00:17.880 when we push past this low well people
02:00:19.880 are going to sell people are going going
02:00:22.119 to get into short positions underneath
02:00:23.840 this low
02:00:25.079 right okay and Market's going to move
02:00:27.400 lower right cuz that's what they think
02:00:28.560 is going to happen in an uptrend when we
02:00:31.360 push past a high in an uptrend what do
02:00:33.840 people often do they often place a buy
02:00:36.599 position why because they think hey the
02:00:39.440 Market's going to move higher why CU
02:00:41.239 we're in an uptrend when Market moves
02:00:43.239 past the high what do people do above
02:00:45.280 the high they press buy there's buy
02:00:47.280 orders above these highs okay cuz what
02:00:49.840 are they expecting price to do they're
02:00:51.320 expecting price to go
02:00:53.239 higher now this is true to an extent
02:00:57.679 until the market wants to change
02:00:59.040 directions how can the market have the
02:01:01.280 ability to change directions what gives
02:01:03.360 it the ability to change directions
02:01:04.800 through liquidity and what is liquidity
02:01:06.760 resting orders above highs and lows
02:01:08.880 something else that we need to
02:01:10.199 understand about uptrends and downtrends
02:01:12.679 is when we're in an
02:01:14.079 uptrend making higher highs and higher
02:01:16.239 lows we have to understand when we're
02:01:18.040 making this move down even though we're
02:01:20.760 in an uptrend not every single person in
02:01:23.079 the market sees this as an uptrend I
02:01:25.480 know this might get confusing but you
02:01:27.079 got to bear with me not everybody sees
02:01:28.880 this as an uptrend so they see this move
02:01:30.599 down and what are some people doing they
02:01:33.119 are selling so they're entering into
02:01:34.960 short positions
02:01:36.360 here and where are they putting their
02:01:39.239 stop loss they're putting their stop
02:01:40.760 loss above these highs so when they
02:01:42.920 enter into a sell position right here
02:01:45.679 they essentially are committing to
02:01:47.960 buying back their position at a higher
02:01:51.239 price up here if price pushes up there
02:01:54.199 so there are pending buy orders up here
02:01:56.560 not only that but when this High gets
02:01:58.679 pushed above the people who thought it
02:02:00.480 was an uptrend in the first place are
02:02:02.320 pressing by why because they say hey
02:02:05.159 we're in an uptrend I think price is
02:02:06.960 going to go higher so what lies above
02:02:10.000 these highs here a massive amount of buy
02:02:12.920 orders now same thing in a downtrend in
02:02:15.760 a downtrend what lies underneath these
02:02:18.400 lows well for the people that think and
02:02:20.800 know that it's a downtrend when this low
02:02:22.800 gets pushed past what are they going to
02:02:24.119 be doing they're going to be pressing
02:02:25.400 sell okay they're going to be pressing
02:02:27.400 sell because they're like hey we're in a
02:02:28.800 downtrend price is going to go lower on
02:02:31.520 top of that the people who saw this mini
02:02:33.880 retracement up the people who saw this
02:02:36.199 move up to make the lower high they
02:02:39.280 might have thought hey we're going to go
02:02:40.599 into an uptrend so if they bought on
02:02:42.639 this move up where is their stop- loss
02:02:44.159 going to be where are they going to have
02:02:46.360 to sell their shares at a lower price to
02:02:49.840 lose their trade underneath these lows
02:02:52.480 so not only do we have people who are
02:02:55.079 buying in the market down here getting
02:02:56.880 stopped out and having to sell their by
02:02:59.960 positions at a lower price underneath
02:03:01.560 these lows but we also have people who
02:03:03.320 are trying to sell the market once these
02:03:04.960 lows get pushed underneath so we have a
02:03:07.520 ton of sell orders underneath lows
02:03:09.960 within the market so we have a ton of
02:03:11.920 buy orders above highs and we have a ton
02:03:14.639 of sell orders underneath lows now let's
02:03:17.960 think back to that example that I was
02:03:20.000 just telling you guys about what happens
02:03:21.599 when a big player or the algorithm needs
02:03:25.000 to fill a massive amount of orders to
02:03:28.239 change the current direction or to
02:03:30.159 change the trend of the current market
02:03:33.079 it needs orders to fill where is it
02:03:35.679 going to find those
02:03:37.920 orders above highs and Below lows
02:03:42.360 because there are buy orders above highs
02:03:44.320 and there sell orders below lows so
02:03:46.199 you're probably saying okay so when we
02:03:47.679 go underneath a low what do we do do we
02:03:50.559 press sell no or I mean it's not that
02:03:54.079 simple it's not just we push past a low
02:03:55.719 and you press a button if it were that
02:03:57.800 easy everybody would be rich this is
02:03:59.440 just a step in the right direction but
02:04:02.239 when we push underneath lows what does
02:04:04.119 the market have the opportunity emphasis
02:04:07.040 on the word opportunity because it
02:04:10.239 doesn't have to it can continue this
02:04:13.360 downtrend right but every time it moves
02:04:16.199 underneath one of these lows it does
02:04:18.000 have the opportunity to what sweep this
02:04:22.520 liquidity use these sell orders to do
02:04:25.520 what fill their massive amount of buy
02:04:27.840 orders to change the direction of the
02:04:29.480 market and that is what liquidity is and
02:04:32.400 that is what a liquidity sweep is a
02:04:35.639 liquidity sweep which is by far the most
02:04:38.440 important Confluence that I'm going to
02:04:39.800 teach you is when the market manipulates
02:04:42.719 a high or a low within the current Trend
02:04:46.280 to fill their massive amounts of orders
02:04:49.880 to change the direction
02:04:52.880 of the trend to cause a reversal so in
02:04:55.599 this case we're in an uptrend we move
02:04:57.320 past a high the people that thought it
02:04:59.320 was an uptrend what are they doing
02:05:00.639 they're pressing by the people who
02:05:02.520 thought it was going to go into a
02:05:04.320 downtrend who had a sell position in
02:05:07.360 what happens to them they get stopped
02:05:08.800 out they have to buy back their sell
02:05:10.159 positions at a higher price causing them
02:05:11.760 to lose money but then what does that
02:05:13.719 give the market the ability to do fill
02:05:15.719 their sell positions to cause price to
02:05:18.320 actually go down does that make sense
02:05:21.480 now you're probably saying well how do I
02:05:23.440 identify how do I know what high and
02:05:26.199 what low is important and which one is
02:05:28.760 which one price is going to reverse off
02:05:30.520 of don't worry I'm going to teach you
02:05:32.159 that but the first thing that I want you
02:05:33.840 to do is to think that I'm not a crazy
02:05:36.119 lunatic and show you guys this on the
02:05:37.760 charts I'll show you a really awesome
02:05:40.119 and hilarious liquidity sweep or at
02:05:42.960 least it's funny to me remember that
02:05:45.920 super scary horrible
02:05:49.480 sickness that was going around in the
02:05:51.800 year
02:05:53.840 2020 was it really a super
02:05:57.480 dangerous super scary
02:06:00.320 illness or was it
02:06:03.000 just a liquidity
02:06:05.360 sweep and a catalyst to be able to fill
02:06:09.159 all the rich people's
02:06:11.159 orders to make them 10 times richer than
02:06:14.760 they already
02:06:17.199 are what did price do and keep in mind
02:06:20.440 there's liquidity on every single time
02:06:22.040 frame there are highs and lows on every
02:06:23.679 single time frame these confluences show
02:06:25.760 up on every single time
02:06:28.199 frame what did price do during the two
02:06:31.079 months that everybody was freaking out
02:06:32.840 it pushed underneath one two and three
02:06:36.119 lows and what did that give the market
02:06:38.400 makers and the richest people in the
02:06:39.920 world the opportunity to
02:06:41.719 do to press buy and to fill their orders
02:06:45.559 and to cause the market to go
02:06:48.440 up so not only can we see that on a high
02:06:51.079 time frame with a news Catalyst but we
02:06:54.559 can also see it on low time frames
02:06:57.119 actually we see it on a daily basis look
02:07:00.079 at this right here this was an example
02:07:02.559 that I just showed you guys for examples
02:07:04.639 of not breaks some structure we see big
02:07:07.280 move
02:07:08.440 down we push underneath one low we push
02:07:11.599 underneath two lows and then following
02:07:13.880 that what does Market do boom it rips up
02:07:16.599 we can see this on even lower time
02:07:19.440 frames market right here it's in a
02:07:24.440 downtrend imagine if you are at this
02:07:27.639 current price you see a chart that looks
02:07:29.920 like this I know it seems easy in
02:07:31.920 hindsight but it is difficult when you
02:07:33.760 get into the actual markets we see price
02:07:36.239 that looks like this just realistically
02:07:38.840 any normal person looking at this chart
02:07:40.840 is probably like wow this looks like
02:07:42.520 [ __ ] it's going to go lower it's exactly
02:07:44.800 what they want you to think let's watch
02:07:46.880 this candle
02:07:48.920 form boom
02:07:52.880 we come down we take out this low we get
02:07:56.199 everybody to press sell we we get
02:07:58.760 everybody who bought on this mini move
02:08:00.719 up to exit their buy positions and then
02:08:03.280 what does that give the market makers
02:08:05.159 and the rich people the opportunity to
02:08:08.320 do make a [ __ ] ton of
02:08:11.040 money and causes the market to go up
02:08:13.880 this happens on the one minute time
02:08:15.320 frame it happens on the 15-minute time
02:08:17.040 frame it happens on the 5 minute time
02:08:18.840 frame it happens on every single time
02:08:21.520 time frame liquidity sweeps are what
02:08:24.559 move the market liquidity and imbalances
02:08:27.920 is what moves the market so this is a
02:08:30.599 very very important concept that I want
02:08:31.960 to teach you guys I mean matter of fact
02:08:33.760 we actually saw a huge High time frame
02:08:35.719 liquidity sweep today look at this High
02:08:38.480 time frame low another high time frame
02:08:40.599 low what did we just do today we just
02:08:44.119 swept out this low swept out this low
02:08:46.960 and we swept out this
02:08:49.320 low and now look at what price is
02:08:52.320 doing this is the magic pill this is
02:08:55.960 what is going to help you turn
02:08:57.159 profitable but I'm telling you right now
02:08:59.400 it is not as easy as just saying oh look
02:09:01.840 there's a high I'm going to press sell
02:09:04.639 why because we have to think back to
02:09:05.920 those Trends right we already showed
02:09:08.199 that the market moves in higher highs
02:09:09.679 and higher lows so if we press sell at
02:09:11.679 every single high and press buy at every
02:09:15.199 at after every single low that gets
02:09:17.159 pushed past we are going to be losing
02:09:19.360 and we're going to be a horrible Trader
02:09:21.520 so now that we know how F first thing
02:09:24.199 that I want you guys to do pause this
02:09:25.440 video and go onto your trading View and
02:09:27.760 just just just identify a time where
02:09:31.360 Market has moved underneath a low and
02:09:34.079 then changed Direction Just identify
02:09:36.440 five liquidity sweeps in each Direction
02:09:38.760 so at least you guys know that I'm not
02:09:40.239 crazy and you guys can see and identify
02:09:42.079 these things so you guys know that it's
02:09:43.840 real but it's not as easy as just
02:09:46.199 pressing buy when we move underneath a
02:09:48.079 low and pressing sell when we move above
02:09:50.639 a high we're going to get way more in
02:09:52.679 depth about understanding what Highs are
02:09:54.840 important what lows are important and
02:09:57.520 what times to be looking for these highs
02:10:00.239 and lows are important okay but the
02:10:02.239 first thing that we just need to do is
02:10:03.639 just understand that hey this thing
02:10:05.440 works and it's real and it's how the
02:10:07.360 market fills its orders to move in the
02:10:08.880 direction that it wants to go call me
02:10:11.119 crazy but I just showed you multiple
02:10:13.400 examples I just showed you a global
02:10:15.599 worldwide example of how the US
02:10:18.440 manipulated not only you guys but
02:10:20.960 literally literally every single person
02:10:22.639 in the entire world to be fearful to
02:10:25.679 literally fill their
02:10:27.800 orders that should piss you
02:10:30.679 off that they used
02:10:33.360 you you are getting used we are no
02:10:36.599 longer going to be the ones that are
02:10:38.040 getting used by the market and by the
02:10:40.400 people that are rich and wealthy we are
02:10:43.199 going to start trading with them we are
02:10:46.639 going to start trading like them we are
02:10:48.440 going to start trading with them and
02:10:50.320 eventually we will become one of them
02:10:52.440 hopefully not as rude and as much of a
02:10:54.840 dick but again these liquidity sweeps
02:10:58.400 they are what move the market I mean
02:11:00.280 again we can see literally on a weekly
02:11:01.800 time frame boom huge leg down what do we
02:11:03.599 do we take out this low then following
02:11:05.400 that what does the market do it moves up
02:11:07.800 these it's not a lie it is real and it
02:11:11.000 is how the market moves so now that we
02:11:14.559 know how to identify liquidity I want I
02:11:17.760 want to put a pin in this and now but
02:11:21.360 before we put it put like how to put all
02:11:24.040 of these things together I know your
02:11:25.719 brain is like okay I know what a trend
02:11:27.440 is I know what a high and low is like
02:11:29.119 when can I actually understand where the
02:11:30.840 Market's going to go when can I
02:11:33.360 understand this Tyler or tjr sorry whoa
02:11:36.559 legal name dropped I know everybody
02:11:38.559 already knows my name but when can I
02:11:40.079 figure out where the Market's going to
02:11:41.239 go just be patient I want to teach you
02:11:43.599 guys every single Confluence first so I
02:11:46.360 taught you break of structure I just
02:11:47.800 taught you liquidity sweeps I'm now
02:11:50.079 going to teach you guys about imbalances
02:11:51.639 and fair value gaps the again liquidity
02:11:54.000 and imbalances make the market move the
02:11:56.079 way that it does okay after I teach you
02:11:58.480 guys all of these confluences and I feel
02:12:00.280 confident that you guys know these
02:12:01.719 confluences and what they are and how
02:12:03.679 they move the market from there that's
02:12:06.800 when we're going to put it all together
02:12:08.280 because I I find that's best like if you
02:12:10.599 guys are able to just like pause this
02:12:12.480 video and be like bet I just want to
02:12:14.400 know and identify liquidity sweeps and
02:12:16.840 where they are in the market go [ __ ] it
02:12:18.719 like I have a I have homework for you
02:12:20.320 literally go on every single time frame
02:12:22.599 that you have up here and try and find
02:12:24.760 try and find a liquidity sweep on every
02:12:26.280 single time frame where price moves
02:12:28.079 above a high and then changes Direction
02:12:29.920 and break structure to the downside
02:12:31.599 that's what I want you guys to do find
02:12:33.480 five examples of when price moved above
02:12:35.800 a high just to sweep liquidity and then
02:12:38.679 caused a break of structure to the
02:12:40.000 downside I also want you guys to find
02:12:42.440 five examples of when price moved
02:12:44.199 underneath a low and then cause the
02:12:46.320 break of structure to the upside to
02:12:47.800 change direction because not only does
02:12:49.679 that reinforce that liquidity sweeps are
02:12:51.639 real but that also helps on both
02:12:54.280 confluences why be and how are liquidity
02:12:56.639 sweeps confirmed well when we push
02:12:58.440 underneath a low and then we break
02:12:59.880 structure to the upside it's it's like
02:13:01.880 well yeah orders were filled we just
02:13:03.559 broke structure we just changed the
02:13:05.000 [ __ ] Trend how else would that happen
02:13:07.079 with orders being filled with liquidity
02:13:09.119 being
02:13:10.040 filled so now that we understand that
02:13:13.199 let's get into imbalances it's pretty
02:13:16.119 much like the opposite of liquidity
02:13:19.119 almost but it's it's it's in the
02:13:21.679 greatest of all time in terms of
02:13:23.599 confluences and is huge for us to
02:13:27.920 understand where we want the market to
02:13:29.719 go on a daily basis and again I know
02:13:32.360 you're like how are we going to put this
02:13:33.719 all together trusted me you guys have
02:13:36.199 trusted me this far it's been like two
02:13:37.880 hours already I we're thugging it out
02:13:40.559 I'm making this video for you guys I'm
02:13:42.280 makeing like this is literally
02:13:43.840 everything that you guys need to know
02:13:45.119 this is [ __ ] everything I'm telling
02:13:46.679 you guys right now this is literally
02:13:48.159 [ __ ] every single thing that you guys
02:13:49.920 need to know and Y are chilling after
02:13:52.800 this one [ __ ] video this one video is
02:13:55.800 literally teaching you a to [ __ ] Z
02:13:59.079 how to become a profitable Trader I'm
02:14:01.320 doing it all bro I'm doing it all and
02:14:03.119 I'm trying my best all right so let's
02:14:06.440 get into fair value gaps now imbalances
02:14:09.320 or and or fair value
02:14:11.719 gaps they're the same
02:14:16.639 thing often abbreviated as fbgs
02:14:21.760 what are they I know you can't use the
02:14:24.159 definition in the whatever the name in
02:14:27.159 the definition but I often I often do
02:14:30.119 this it's
02:14:33.079 imbalanced price
02:14:36.719 action that needs to
02:14:40.199 be
02:14:42.079 balanced
02:14:43.639 out the a
02:14:47.119 retrace so imbalances SL fair value gaps
02:14:51.079 I
02:14:51.760 know it I'm using the whatever the def
02:14:55.559 the word the word in the definition but
02:14:58.440 deal with it I'm not a grammar person
02:15:01.040 it's imbalance price action that needs
02:15:03.280 to be balanced out via a retrace first
02:15:05.639 of all if you guys don't know what a
02:15:06.840 retrace is when we're in an
02:15:09.199 uptrend it's the down move so the down
02:15:12.079 move is called the retrace so this is
02:15:13.880 called the retrace why do we call it a
02:15:15.679 retrace because when the overall trend
02:15:17.239 is up it's just retracing so it can go
02:15:20.040 higher re retracing the up move so that
02:15:23.159 price can go higher
02:15:25.800 okay same thing to the downside okay so
02:15:29.880 we have
02:15:30.960 boom retrace up move down retrace move
02:15:36.199 down retrace extension retrace extension
02:15:39.920 these moves up are retraces within a
02:15:42.639 downtrend moves up are retraces in a
02:15:45.040 downtrend moves down our retraces in an
02:15:47.880 uptrend okay so all that imbalances and
02:15:50.400 for value gaps are a price
02:15:53.239 range that is imbalanced that needs to
02:15:56.480 be balanced out via a retrace so I try
02:16:01.000 not to classify things as Candlestick
02:16:03.440 patterns because I'm sure a lot of you
02:16:06.360 guys have probably gone through like
02:16:08.159 some other day Traders thing and they're
02:16:10.840 talking about Head and Shoulders pattern
02:16:13.679 they're talking about double top double
02:16:17.400 bottom Candlestick pattern I look I'm
02:16:21.719 not going to say it's
02:16:24.199 [ __ ] I will say that when I tried to
02:16:27.400 trade that way it never [ __ ]
02:16:31.639 worked but maybe I was the issue back
02:16:34.478 then but coincidentally when I started
02:16:37.280 trading like this I was no longer the
02:16:40.318 issue and it started working take that
02:16:42.000 for what you will so I'm not a believer
02:16:44.040 in Candlestick patterns however I am a
02:16:46.160 believer in reading and identifying
02:16:49.398 balance imbalance price action where
02:16:52.478 orders are lacking on the chart where
02:16:54.638 orders are resting on the chart to cause
02:16:57.080 price to move the way that it does and
02:16:58.679 that's exactly what an imbalance is and
02:17:01.959 luckily for us we can use Candlestick
02:17:05.160 patterns to demonstrate these so let's
02:17:08.000 just jump straight into this [ __ ] what
02:17:10.080 does an imbalance look like what does a
02:17:11.799 fair value Gap look like it's a three
02:17:13.398 Candlestick pattern this is one
02:17:17.080 Candlestick this is the second
02:17:18.840 candlestick
02:17:21.840 and this is the third
02:17:24.398 Candlestick let me make this an up
02:17:26.439 candle instead of a down candle there we
02:17:29.679 go okay so this is an
02:17:34.439 imbalance this is imbalance price action
02:17:37.160 from this Candlestick Wick to this
02:17:39.398 Candlestick Wick why is this imbalanced
02:17:42.799 price action why is this price action
02:17:45.160 right here imbalanced I'll tell you so
02:17:48.879 the first Candlestick that was made
02:17:51.519 we opened right here at some point in
02:17:53.679 time we had sell orders that pushed us
02:17:55.160 down here at some point in time we had
02:17:56.840 buy orders that pushed us up up here but
02:17:59.120 Al we also had sell orders that had to
02:18:02.318 come in to move price down and then have
02:18:04.359 price close right here this following
02:18:06.920 Candlestick it's a big bullish
02:18:08.679 Candlestick huge move up right we had
02:18:11.840 the highest point that it got to was up
02:18:13.240 here the lowest point that it got to was
02:18:14.799 down here sell orders up here ended up
02:18:16.879 causing price to push down the third
02:18:19.760 candlestick opened right here at some
02:18:22.200 point in time we had buy orders move it
02:18:23.959 all the way up here sell orders moved it
02:18:25.718 down causing it to close here we also at
02:18:28.000 some point in time had sell orders push
02:18:30.398 price down here so throughout all of
02:18:36.040 this I know that was a lot sound like
02:18:38.760 sounded like a lot but in this price
02:18:40.718 range what are we lacking we're lacking
02:18:42.920 sell orders
02:18:44.879 why because if we think about the first
02:18:47.599 Candlestick at some point in time we had
02:18:50.799 buy orders that push price up and then
02:18:52.760 sell orders move price down from here so
02:18:55.000 boom sell orders stopped here and then
02:18:57.718 we see boom huge bullish
02:18:59.879 Candlestick then the next candle okay we
02:19:03.840 see price open at some point in time
02:19:06.120 price had sell orders that push price
02:19:07.679 down to here but the sell orders stopped
02:19:09.439 here so where is there a lack of sell
02:19:12.120 orders right
02:19:15.439 here within this price range and this is
02:19:18.799 how we identify bullish Fair value gaps
02:19:22.519 from the top of the first candlesticks
02:19:26.080 Wick to the bottom of the third
02:19:29.200 candlesticks Wick that is how we
02:19:31.240 identify a bullish fair value Gap should
02:19:34.200 have made this green so there's a lack
02:19:36.478 of sell orders within here when or if
02:19:40.359 price comes down and
02:19:43.120 retraces into this imbalanced price
02:19:45.959 action it's imbalanced because there's a
02:19:48.359 lack of sell orders so when we get the
02:19:51.080 sell orders to come down to balance it
02:19:54.280 out and when we fill this Gap and we get
02:19:58.960 buy orders within here what is likely
02:20:01.200 going to happen because there's a lack
02:20:03.080 of sell orders once we hit it with some
02:20:05.760 buy orders in this in this price range
02:20:07.960 where there's a lack of sell orders what
02:20:09.359 is go what is that going to cause price
02:20:10.880 to
02:20:12.120 do go higher this is a bullish fair
02:20:15.680 value Gap now let me show you an example
02:20:18.080 of what a bullish fair value Gap is not
02:20:21.319 well what happens if this candlestick's
02:20:24.479 Wick goes all the way down here and this
02:20:26.840 Candlestick Wick goes up here what
02:20:28.880 happens if the Candlestick Wicks overlap
02:20:31.120 well then there's no imbalance there's
02:20:32.560 no imbalance price action there's no
02:20:34.640 imbalance price action why because sell
02:20:37.040 orders were were here at some point in
02:20:39.280 time price moved up here and sell orders
02:20:41.080 had to push price down and also on this
02:20:43.800 third Candlestick at some point in time
02:20:45.760 sell orders had to push price down to
02:20:47.359 here so these Wicks overlap so there's
02:20:49.720 no bullish for value Gap within here
02:20:51.760 this on the other hand there's a lack of
02:20:53.359 sell orders this is a bullish fair value
02:20:56.399 Gap now what's a bearish fair value Gap
02:20:59.399 well also something that I want you guys
02:21:01.960 to keep in mind there's two things that
02:21:04.200 I want you guys to keep in mind the only
02:21:05.960 Candlestick color that
02:21:07.800 matters is the middle Candlestick so
02:21:11.080 obviously if it's a bullish fair value
02:21:12.960 Gap this Candlestick is going to be
02:21:14.359 green or in my case blue if it's a
02:21:17.319 bearish fair value Gap this C the
02:21:19.399 Candlestick color is going going to be
02:21:21.040 red or in my case black the first and
02:21:25.399 the third Candlestick color doesn't
02:21:27.200 matter this Candlestick could be a
02:21:29.000 bearish Candlestick as long as these
02:21:30.960 Candlestick Wicks don't overlap there is
02:21:33.200 imbalanced price another thing that I
02:21:35.720 want you guys to know about fair value
02:21:37.200 gaps is they are just like penises no I
02:21:40.600 am not joking a fair value Gap is the
02:21:43.080 equivalent to a penis a male follicle a
02:21:46.840 male
02:21:47.880 limb let me explain side does not matter
02:21:52.479 we as gay Traders as day Traders we do
02:21:56.760 not care about the size all that we care
02:22:00.040 about is what lies within we care about
02:22:03.520 the personality we yearn to learn more
02:22:07.520 to balance out that imbalance regardless
02:22:10.680 of the size no matter what size it is we
02:22:13.880 want it we need it I need it okay plain
02:22:18.479 and [ __ ] simple a fair value Gap
02:22:21.680 is a
02:22:23.479 dick literally as simple as that so a
02:22:26.160 bearish fair value Gap how do we find it
02:22:29.680 from the first candle's bottom Wick to
02:22:33.080 the third candle's top Wick again it
02:22:36.120 doesn't
02:22:37.120 matter if this Candlestick is
02:22:41.439 black
02:22:43.479 blue
02:22:45.359 Chinese or Indian we don't see color on
02:22:49.680 the first in the third Candlestick the
02:22:53.000 middle Candlestick we're racist as [ __ ]
02:22:56.840 if it's black it's bearish or at least
02:23:00.120 on my that was if it's if it's red then
02:23:04.280 it's bearish on your guys's chart if
02:23:06.240 it's black it's bearish on my chart
02:23:09.800 there's no racial correlation there I
02:23:12.240 love everybody from everywhere it's just
02:23:15.040 for the example purposes it helps the
02:23:17.000 VIS it helps us visualize this a lot
02:23:19.319 better the penis correlation the race
02:23:22.479 correlation it all it's all for your own
02:23:24.760 benefit you guess what you're going to
02:23:26.720 remember this now I I'm telling you this
02:23:29.319 I promise you you won't remember this
02:23:31.080 [ __ ] when old [ __ ] gezer is like yeah
02:23:34.960 when you get the imbalance price action
02:23:37.080 and then the Enigma goes up and wants to
02:23:40.800 balance out the fractal and the Enigma
02:23:43.439 for the power of three
02:23:48.720 and no we don't give a [ __ ] about that
02:23:51.560 we're car we're we're talking about
02:23:53.200 blacks we're talking about whites we're
02:23:55.479 talking about Indians we're talking
02:23:57.120 about Asians we're talking about Dick
02:23:59.479 we're talking about gay we're talking
02:24:01.279 about everything why cuz it what it's
02:24:03.960 what keeps us locked in it's what it's
02:24:06.359 how we remember it I write I hope you
02:24:08.640 write down in your notes a fair value
02:24:10.399 Gap is like a dick female day Traders
02:24:12.800 don't get mad at me don't get mad at me
02:24:16.319 girls you know it's true period period a
02:24:20.880 fair value Gap just like that dick
02:24:23.399 period that size doesn't matter it's
02:24:25.680 just what lies in It's Just What Lies
02:24:28.439 Beneath the sheets baby it's just what
02:24:30.840 can do it's just what can make that [ __ ]
02:24:32.920 work it's just the motion of the ocean
02:24:36.439 it don't matter about that dick baby it
02:24:39.120 just matter about what's inside you
02:24:41.600 period if you got that dog I'm going to
02:24:44.359 take it
02:24:45.479 R that's enough for now okay so a bears
02:24:48.640 for Value Gap is from the first
02:24:51.080 candlestick's Wick down to the third
02:24:54.160 candlesticks Wick up so what is there a
02:24:57.680 lack of within here there's a lack of
02:24:59.399 buy orders when price moves up into that
02:25:04.200 fair value Gap where there's a lack of
02:25:06.560 buy orders and it balances out price
02:25:09.359 action and it fills its sell orders
02:25:12.160 within there since there's a lack of buy
02:25:14.120 orders what is that going to cause price
02:25:15.600 to do go down and continue the trend a
02:25:18.439 fair value Gap in an imbalance is is a
02:25:21.279 Confluence that I like to call a
02:25:23.200 continuation
02:25:25.040 Confluence write that down a fair value
02:25:27.760 Gap is a continuation Confluence okay
02:25:31.040 fair value gaps are continuation
02:25:32.560 confluences why because they continue
02:25:34.520 the trend that we are currently in break
02:25:37.399 of structure okay let me just go ahead
02:25:40.439 and label these really quick I might as
02:25:42.120 well make make this reversal confluences
02:25:45.880 liquidity sweeps
02:25:48.800 confirmation confluence
02:25:51.080 uences break of structures and inverse
02:25:53.720 for Value gaps we haven't got to inverse
02:25:55.240 for Value gaps yet don't worry about it
02:25:56.920 but I just want this so you guys can
02:25:58.279 screenshot it or write it down in your
02:25:59.560 notes
02:26:01.840 continuation
02:26:04.399 confluences fair value gaps order blocks
02:26:07.520 we're getting to those next breaker
02:26:09.200 blocks and equilibrium and another
02:26:12.080 confirmation Confluence is an smt and
02:26:15.040 we'll get to all of these we're going to
02:26:17.000 talk about every single one of these
02:26:18.520 okay so we already learned about
02:26:19.840 liquidity sweeps we just learned about
02:26:22.200 confirmation we just learned about fair
02:26:24.120 value gaps now why are liquidity sweeps
02:26:26.200 reversal confluences because they are
02:26:28.720 the signs of a of a trend reversal why
02:26:32.520 are break of structures confirmation
02:26:35.200 confluences because they
02:26:37.720 confirm the break of structure they
02:26:40.640 confirm the break of the trend they
02:26:42.800 confirm the reversal and you're going to
02:26:45.080 see when I give you guys this strategy
02:26:47.760 we go from Reversal confluence to
02:26:50.439 confirmation Confluence to continuation
02:26:53.200 Confluence to execution we go from
02:26:55.720 liquidity sweep to break of structure or
02:26:58.319 inverse fair value Gap or smt down to
02:27:01.479 fair value Gap order Block Breaker block
02:27:04.080 or equilibrium to execution because it's
02:27:07.040 all three steps of a full Trend
02:27:10.279 reversal we need a sign of reversal via
02:27:13.080 liquidity sweep we need confirmation of
02:27:15.520 the trend break and the new trend shift
02:27:18.520 via break of structure or inverse value
02:27:20.520 Gap or smt which we're get yet to get to
02:27:23.040 and then we need proof and actual like
02:27:26.319 belief in this new change of structure
02:27:28.399 and in this new break of trend that we
02:27:30.840 just had by showing what continuation of
02:27:33.479 the trend via what fair value gaps so
02:27:35.920 just take a take a picture of that for
02:27:37.640 now we'll get back to that but now I
02:27:40.399 want you want to show you guys fair
02:27:42.040 value gaps on charts just like liquidity
02:27:44.240 sweeps fair value gaps are on every
02:27:47.319 single time frame and you can this is
02:27:49.840 something about fair value gaps going
02:27:51.640 back to dicks okay fair value gaps are
02:27:53.920 just like dicks you don't want to [ __ ]
02:27:55.560 every single dick okay there's only some
02:27:57.880 dicks that you want same thing with
02:27:59.560 liquidity sweeps okay you only want to
02:28:01.800 liquidate some people and you want to
02:28:03.880 leave some people unliquidated you don't
02:28:05.840 know what's going on in their junk the
02:28:07.359 junk in their trunk okay we don't want
02:28:09.319 to get down in there we don't know the
02:28:11.760 past we don't know their history it's
02:28:13.279 the same thing with fair value gaps and
02:28:15.000 liquidity sweeps okay and I'm going to
02:28:16.600 show and tell you guys how to identify
02:28:18.600 the correct fair value gaps how do to I
02:28:20.800 identify the right liquidity sweep but
02:28:22.840 right now I just want you guys to
02:28:25.439 understand that these things work so I
02:28:27.200 just want we're going to show examples
02:28:29.120 of this on the chart and then from there
02:28:31.399 we'll put a pin in it just like we did
02:28:33.240 with liquidity sweeps something else
02:28:35.120 that I want you guys to keep in mind
02:28:36.439 fair value gaps are nothing without
02:28:39.000 context so I can go out here and I can
02:28:41.640 Mark out all these fair value gaps but
02:28:43.920 they don't mean [ __ ] without the right
02:28:45.720 context of price so I can Mark out this
02:28:48.279 is a bearish fair value Gap right here
02:28:50.120 why didn't price move down off of it
02:28:52.399 well because we don't have the right
02:28:53.640 context to be using this right now we we
02:28:56.120 had another bearish for Value Gap right
02:28:57.960 here price actually did fill this one
02:29:00.359 and then it did move down off of it okay
02:29:03.160 it's all about the context I can pull I
02:29:05.399 can show a whole bunch of f value gaps
02:29:07.479 that like this bearish F value Gap right
02:29:10.240 here okay first let's let's do this a
02:29:13.200 little bit slower because I know I'm
02:29:14.359 speedr running through these but okay
02:29:16.399 first candlesticks bearish for Value Gap
02:29:19.080 how do we mark it out from the bottom of
02:29:21.439 the first candlesticks Wick to the top
02:29:23.319 of the third candlesticks Wick what is
02:29:24.680 it a three Candlestick pattern one two 3
02:29:27.560 we just look for the gaps the easiest
02:29:29.600 way to identify it is like oh look
02:29:31.359 there's three candlesticks and there's a
02:29:33.240 gap between them that must be a fair
02:29:34.880 value Gap look at this right here look
02:29:37.880 there's three candlesticks and there's a
02:29:39.279 gap between them that must be what a
02:29:41.840 fair value Gap and then you can see and
02:29:43.720 just look at the Candlestick color in
02:29:45.040 between them boom it's a bullish fair
02:29:47.399 value Gap three candlesticks with a gap
02:29:49.840 between between them oh that's a bullish
02:29:51.800 for Value
02:29:52.920 Gap three candlesticks with a gap
02:29:55.200 between them oh that's a bearish for
02:29:57.640 Value Gap very easy to identify there's
02:30:00.359 a fair value Gap here there's a fair
02:30:02.600 value Gap here there's fair value gaps
02:30:06.200 all over the place now what I want you
02:30:09.160 guys to do pause the video go to your
02:30:11.160 chart right now identify five bearish
02:30:13.200 for Value gaps identify five bullish
02:30:15.479 fair value gaps what I want to show you
02:30:18.040 guys on top of this lesson is show you
02:30:20.120 guys how they get respected because fair
02:30:23.120 value gaps can get disrespected and they
02:30:25.319 can also get respected and this is kind
02:30:27.040 of going to leave lead us into inverse
02:30:29.000 fair value gaps right after this
02:30:30.560 explanation so this is a good
02:30:33.760 one right H right here we have a bearish
02:30:36.240 for Value Gap why is it a bearish for
02:30:37.960 Value Gap because the third candle is a
02:30:40.160 move down okay we have one candle two
02:30:43.640 candle three
02:30:45.399 candle we take the bottom Wick of the
02:30:48.040 first candle to the top Wick of the
02:30:50.000 third candle and we just boom we draw a
02:30:52.840 little box on it this fair value Gap it
02:30:55.200 got filled right but then we got a
02:30:58.760 Candlestick
02:31:00.000 closure above
02:31:01.800 it so what did we do to this fair value
02:31:04.640 Gap right here we disrespected it this
02:31:06.240 is no this fair value Gap is no longer
02:31:09.600 valid okay for a fair value Gap to get
02:31:12.359 respected we have to fill it without get
02:31:15.640 getting a Candlestick closure above it
02:31:18.680 and then get a candlestick closure down
02:31:21.439 it doesn't matter if the Candlestick
02:31:22.640 closes down within the fair value Gap
02:31:24.760 just matters that we come in fill it and
02:31:26.800 then the next Candlestick or it doesn't
02:31:28.920 have to be the direct next candles stick
02:31:30.520 it could be one candle up two candle up
02:31:32.359 three candle up as long as it doesn't
02:31:34.880 close above the fair value
02:31:37.120 Gap and as long as we get a candle down
02:31:39.920 out of it boom that's that's it being
02:31:42.680 respected as long as it's in the right
02:31:44.880 context price should move down same
02:31:47.080 thing on a bullish fair value Gap let me
02:31:49.479 find a an example this is this is a good
02:31:52.359 example of a current one that's about to
02:31:54.000 get disrespected as long as price Clos
02:31:55.720 underneath it but
02:31:58.359 look we have a bullish for Value Gap
02:32:00.640 right here how do I know that first Wick
02:32:03.720 I mean just look right there's a gap
02:32:05.640 between the three candles first Wick's
02:32:08.920 or the first candle's top Wick the third
02:32:10.920 candle's bottom Wick this is the gap
02:32:15.000 price right now currently disrespecting
02:32:17.399 it we'll know for a fact if it gets
02:32:19.520 disres expected once this candle closes
02:32:21.640 in 8 minutes again just because price is
02:32:24.279 down here like this right now doesn't
02:32:26.600 mean that okay this this for Value Gap
02:32:28.960 is said and done no it can leave it as
02:32:32.359 long as price closes in here if it
02:32:34.880 leaves a long ass Wick like this that's
02:32:37.160 okay I'm fine with that okay and I'll
02:32:39.960 show you an example of that of a fair
02:32:41.600 value Gap getting filled with a long ass
02:32:43.279 Wick and it's still being valid this is
02:32:45.640 a good example of this uh fair value Gap
02:32:47.680 being respected perfectly so what is
02:32:49.560 this this is a bearish fair value
02:32:52.840 Gap and again we get one candle Clos two
02:32:55.840 candle close three like whatever there's
02:32:58.399 a whole bunch of candle closures within
02:32:59.960 this but as long as the candle doesn't
02:33:01.760 close above the fair value Gap it's
02:33:05.960 still valid and then boom what do we get
02:33:07.960 we get a bearish candle closure
02:33:09.840 confirming that sell orders have been
02:33:11.399 filled and then price ends up moving
02:33:13.479 down also I just want to point something
02:33:15.720 out to you guys look at
02:33:17.920 this so you can see the magic start to
02:33:20.840 work liquidity
02:33:23.800 sweep we were current we were within an
02:33:27.560 uptrend break of structure to the
02:33:29.680 downside on this Black Candle followed
02:33:32.920 by fair value Gap getting filled price
02:33:35.240 moves down anyways now that we know let
02:33:37.920 me show you one or two more examples of
02:33:41.439 this being valid so we have look right
02:33:43.359 here another bearish for Value Gap price
02:33:46.800 comes up into the bearish for Value Gap
02:33:48.520 it accumulates for a little bit and then
02:33:50.319 boom goes down let's try and find some
02:33:54.600 more examples here again what I want you
02:33:57.920 guys to remember is forfeit value gaps
02:34:01.439 when you guys start trading these you
02:34:02.960 guys are going to think these are magic
02:34:04.160 pill and you guys are going to start
02:34:05.240 marking them out and then you guys go go
02:34:06.840 and start pressing buy and sell every
02:34:08.399 time a bearish or bullish fair value Gap
02:34:10.200 gets filled well guess what that's how
02:34:11.680 you lose you lose by trading these
02:34:13.840 confluences just by themselves you win
02:34:16.319 by trading them together in a good
02:34:18.279 strategical manner that is optimal for
02:34:21.319 efficient price for efficient price
02:34:23.120 movement and I'm going to teach you guys
02:34:24.960 that we just have to get through all the
02:34:26.840 I know like day trading is a hard skill
02:34:28.479 so we have to get through these steps
02:34:29.920 first this is a good example of bears
02:34:33.279 for valy Gap getting respected with the
02:34:35.080 wick that actually went above it so
02:34:36.920 right here notice how the wick goes
02:34:39.640 above this bearish for Value Gap right
02:34:42.960 it goes above this bearish for Value Gap
02:34:45.160 however what does it do it doesn't clo
02:34:48.359 or I mean assuming that the next hour
02:34:50.240 isn't just this huge candle that ends up
02:34:52.359 turning up but assuming that this candle
02:34:54.240 closes like this this bearish fair value
02:34:56.720 Gap is valid it it hasn't been
02:34:59.120 disrespected because it's just like a wi
02:35:00.800 it's just a wick so just like break of
02:35:02.640 structure if it's a wick we don't care
02:35:05.279 okay but a candle closure above a fair
02:35:07.080 value Gap we do care now that leads me
02:35:09.520 into what inverse fair value gaps are an
02:35:12.880 inverse fair value Gap is literally just
02:35:16.120 a fair value Gap getting disrespected so
02:35:19.760 as I mentioned before a inverse fair
02:35:22.560 value Gap is a confirmation Confluence
02:35:27.359 so an inverse for Value Gap I know we're
02:35:30.520 just jumping straight into this but hey
02:35:32.240 man you guys you guys wanted to learn
02:35:33.960 how to trade this is how you guys going
02:35:35.279 are going to learn this [ __ ] an inverse
02:35:37.760 for Value Gap is a fair value Gap that
02:35:41.120 gets disrespected
02:35:44.120 within current order flow that shows a
02:35:49.240 change
02:35:50.319 of
02:35:51.279 trend oops let me change
02:35:54.359 this order flow is just Trend you guys
02:35:56.880 don't have to worry about that an
02:35:58.240 inverse for Value Gap is a fair value
02:36:00.120 Gap that gets disrespected within the
02:36:02.840 current Trend that in turn shows a new
02:36:06.840 change of trend so let's say we're in a
02:36:10.319 downtrend and you're going to start to
02:36:11.840 see how we can start piecing these
02:36:13.399 things together to identify hey when is
02:36:17.000 a low or a high valid for a liquidity
02:36:19.640 sweep let's say we're in a downtrend and
02:36:21.680 we're retracing into a fair value Gap
02:36:24.080 and then we go lower and you're like
02:36:25.960 holy [ __ ] draw
02:36:27.279 liquidity psych we keep going lower we
02:36:30.359 fill another fair value Gap and then we
02:36:32.160 keep going lower and then we keep going
02:36:34.200 lower and then we have another fair
02:36:36.279 value Gap but then what's that we end up
02:36:39.439 disrespecting it when we disrespect a
02:36:42.240 fair value gap or we'll we'll show it in
02:36:45.319 both directions but when we disrespect a
02:36:47.600 bearish fair value Gap
02:36:50.399 within a
02:36:52.640 downtrend it's just like a break of
02:36:55.080 structure in that in order for fair
02:36:58.200 value gaps to be valid when they get
02:37:00.000 filled it's showing that price is going
02:37:02.120 to continue in that Trend Direction well
02:37:05.760 when a fair value Gap gets
02:37:08.560 disrespected what is that likely a sign
02:37:11.120 of that the trend is no longer going to
02:37:14.720 continue in that direction so we can
02:37:16.960 treat an inverse fair value Gap simp
02:37:19.520 similar to a break of structure similar
02:37:22.479 to showing a change in Trend and you'll
02:37:25.760 see here on this fake chart that I drew
02:37:29.560 we come down we sweep out this low and
02:37:33.760 then how do we know that this low was an
02:37:36.120 actual liquidity sweep ah Boogie's
02:37:39.560 coming to say hi how do we know I know
02:37:42.240 Daddy's been working I know buddy I know
02:37:45.479 how do we know that this is a valid low
02:37:50.520 yeah sorry how do we know that this is a
02:37:54.200 got Carri right there how do we know
02:37:56.040 that this is a valid low that swept out
02:37:59.000 these sell orders that actually filled
02:38:00.720 buy orders well with two different ways
02:38:03.640 or three different ways really but the
02:38:06.200 two ways that we know now are either a
02:38:08.279 break of structure so how do we identify
02:38:10.120 break of structure well this high would
02:38:11.960 have to get closed above but sometimes
02:38:14.600 we're lucky enough where there's fair
02:38:16.120 value gaps and these fair value gaps get
02:38:18.840 disrespected before the high gets closed
02:38:20.760 above and it tells us even earlier that
02:38:23.319 these Trends are going to change
02:38:24.760 direction start to piece this together I
02:38:26.760 don't want you guys to think that you're
02:38:28.680 Shadow money wi wizard gang we love
02:38:31.000 casting spells just yet and you know how
02:38:33.800 to do this don't get off this video
02:38:35.640 there's still a lot more to learn but
02:38:37.200 we're almost there so within an uptrend
02:38:39.680 we're making higher highs and higher
02:38:41.200 lows we're retracing into a fair value
02:38:43.319 Gap and we go higher we retrace into a
02:38:45.640 fair value Gap and then we go higher and
02:38:48.000 then we have a fair value Gap right here
02:38:50.600 and then uhoh this fair value Gap gets
02:38:52.520 disrespected we close underneath it
02:38:55.000 there was a whole bunch of buy orders
02:38:56.439 right
02:38:57.200 here how do we know that these buy
02:38:59.160 orders got filled or these buy orders
02:39:01.120 got or these sell orders sorry got
02:39:03.319 transacted with these buy orders because
02:39:06.319 we see a fair value Gap get get
02:39:08.600 disrespected and then boom the trend
02:39:11.600 changes so let's show this on the chart
02:39:13.760 now and again a inverse fair value Gap
02:39:16.200 is literally just a fair value Gap that
02:39:18.160 gets disrespected and again just like
02:39:20.880 with all of our other confluences this
02:39:23.600 happens on what every single time frame
02:39:26.439 there's inverse for Value gaps on the
02:39:28.040 weekly time frame monthly time frame
02:39:29.359 daily time frame 4 hour time frame 1
02:39:30.840 hour time frame 5 minute time frame
02:39:32.399 every single time frame that's the
02:39:33.800 awesome thing about the way that I trade
02:39:35.840 this is a good example here okay so
02:39:38.319 let's look at this price is in a
02:39:41.399 downtrend I'm we're not going to put all
02:39:43.040 the pieces together just yet I just want
02:39:44.840 to show you guys this price is in a
02:39:47.680 downtrend what do we have right
02:39:51.800 here a bearish for Value
02:39:54.479 Gap it gets disrespected by price
02:39:57.720 closing above it we actually also get a
02:39:59.600 break of structure because this was the
02:40:00.800 most recent high in the downtrend so we
02:40:02.760 not only get a break of structure to the
02:40:04.200 upside but we also get an Inver a
02:40:06.399 bearish inverse for or a bullish inverse
02:40:08.520 for Value Gap
02:40:10.520 sorry closure above it price ends up
02:40:13.800 moving higher okay let me show another
02:40:18.319 example TR find a bearish example this
02:40:21.279 is a good example ah now there's a
02:40:22.800 breaking structure before it I want to
02:40:24.120 find a good example of uh when there
02:40:26.720 isn't a break of structure before it
02:40:28.960 this is a good example of there not
02:40:31.240 being a break of structure before it so
02:40:32.760 this is when that that an inverse for
02:40:34.680 Value Gap would come in handy where's
02:40:36.399 the most recent high in this downtrend
02:40:38.279 it's right here or at least until this
02:40:40.560 High gets made but look instead of us
02:40:43.040 having to wait and potentially enter on
02:40:46.080 this candle closure Above This high or
02:40:48.319 above this high
02:40:50.840 we can look to enter on this Candlestick
02:40:53.279 closure why because there's an inverse
02:40:56.160 for Value Gap right here there's a
02:40:57.600 bearish fair value Gap that doesn't get
02:40:59.000 respected this candle that closed above
02:41:00.600 the fair value Gap it got
02:41:05.080 disrespected but again same thing
02:41:07.760 applies there's millions of inverse fair
02:41:10.040 value gaps that happen across every
02:41:12.399 single time frame but not every single
02:41:14.399 one of them is going to cause a reversal
02:41:16.880 not every single break of structure is
02:41:18.560 going to cause a r IAL every single one
02:41:21.000 of these confluences cannot be used on
02:41:23.319 their own they have to be with context
02:41:26.920 okay they have to be used with context
02:41:29.840 and without context they are [ __ ]
02:41:32.080 nothing okay so now let me let me try
02:41:36.760 and find another example again these are
02:41:38.520 on every single time frame so let me go
02:41:40.000 to like the hourly this is a good
02:41:42.120 example right here this actually puts
02:41:44.160 everything together look at this sweep
02:41:47.040 of liquidity a sweep of a high followed
02:41:50.080 by
02:41:52.880 what a bullish fair value Gap that gets
02:41:56.960 disrespected price ends up going
02:42:00.319 down good example
02:42:03.200 here pushes past a
02:42:05.960 high bullish fair value Gap that if
02:42:09.240 price wanted to continue this uptrend
02:42:11.160 should have held we get a candle closure
02:42:13.920 underneath it price moves lower okay so
02:42:17.720 now that we know how to identify fair
02:42:19.319 value gaps and inverse fair value gaps I
02:42:21.680 want to go ahead and talk about all of
02:42:24.040 the other confluences that I use on a
02:42:25.840 daily basis so that's going to be
02:42:27.600 breaker blocks that's going to be order
02:42:29.640 blocks that's going to be equilibrium
02:42:31.520 and then that's going to be smt
02:42:33.080 divergences and then once we have all of
02:42:35.720 that I know it sounds like a lot and
02:42:37.680 that's okay you guys can keep coming
02:42:39.000 back to this video you guys can keep
02:42:41.080 pausing it making sure F first thing do
02:42:43.920 your homework okay get five examples of
02:42:46.279 an inverse for Value Gap in both
02:42:47.560 directions show a fair value Gap getting
02:42:50.479 disrespected I know we're moving quick
02:42:52.279 here but welcome to the game trading
02:42:54.680 moves quick and your life is moving

02:43:06.439 putting things together and you're like
02:43:07.800 wow holy [ __ ] this dude's a wizard
02:43:09.560 Shadow money wizard gang billion
02:43:11.800 trillion dollar baby okay um but with
02:43:16.120 that being said we're going to get into
02:43:18.200 all these other confluence is and then
02:43:19.560 we're going to be able to put every
02:43:21.040 single thing together in a systematic
02:43:24.040 way of trading so that you guys can make
02:43:27.560 billions okay so with that being said
02:43:30.439 let's get into let's get into order
02:43:32.880 blocks and breaker blocks now all right
02:43:35.080 let's talk about order blocks let's talk
02:43:37.479 about breaker blocks and let's talk
02:43:39.800 about [ __ ] order [ __ ] and break your
02:43:44.439 [ __ ] order blocks what are they order
02:43:48.200 blocks what the [ __ ] are these
02:43:52.399 things oh
02:43:54.520 man what are order blocks order blocks
02:43:58.080 I'm lit I'm edging you guys you guys are
02:44:00.120 like just spit it out spit it out tell
02:44:02.920 me what an order block is I'm I'm on day
02:44:05.080 two of learning how to day trade and you
02:44:07.319 just don't even say it anymore all you
02:44:09.960 want to do is just talk about penises
02:44:12.399 and dicks and it's not even funny
02:44:15.000 anymore I've been sitting through three
02:44:16.720 hours of this and guess what Timmy it's
02:44:19.760 my video I I get to decide what we're
02:44:22.720 talking about ever been to jerk mate
02:44:25.359 finals I don't think you have so sit
02:44:27.760 your ass down bronze Buster that's right
02:44:31.680 I'm an emerald edger you haven't made it
02:44:33.720 to my rank yet pipe down before I pipe
02:44:36.960 you order coocks what are they the leg
02:44:42.240 up Third Leg type [ __ ] type [ __ ] the leg
02:44:46.240 up or leg down prior to the liquidity
02:44:53.080 sweep and that's all it is the leg up or
02:44:56.279 leg down prior to the liquidity sweep or
02:44:58.560 it's really that caused the liquidity
02:45:03.680 sweep so how do we identify a liquidity
02:45:06.840 Sweep with boom when we move above a
02:45:09.880 high and then get a break of structure
02:45:11.279 or an inverse for Value Gap following
02:45:13.399 that we just talked about this so a
02:45:16.640 bullish order block is the move move up
02:45:20.640 prior to the liquidity sweep or sorry a
02:45:23.479 bearish order block sorry Down syndrome
02:45:27.040 a bearish order block is the move up
02:45:30.399 prior to the liquid or sorry the move up
02:45:32.880 that causes the liquidity
02:45:35.680 sweep prior to the break of structure
02:45:38.439 okay
02:45:39.640 so this move up right here is considered
02:45:43.680 our order block why is it considered an
02:45:46.359 order block well let's just think back
02:45:48.439 to liquidity sweeps we know there's a
02:45:50.479 whole bunch of buy orders that are above
02:45:52.040 this these highs right so when price
02:45:54.040 moves up to fill these buy orders what
02:45:57.520 is happening on this move up a whole
02:46:00.000 bunch of sell orders are given the
02:46:01.760 ability to be filled because as we're
02:46:03.960 moving up and as we're sweeping out
02:46:06.080 these buy orders and filling these buy
02:46:07.960 orders what are the market makers doing
02:46:10.319 they're filling the sell orders to cause
02:46:11.920 price to go down so what do we know
02:46:14.160 about this price range from the start of
02:46:15.800 the move up to the top of the move up
02:46:18.040 there is a a whole bunch of potential
02:46:20.080 and there's a whole bunch of probability
02:46:21.479 to be able to fill sell orders so if
02:46:24.240 price comes back into this price range
02:46:26.560 where there was a a lot of probability
02:46:28.319 and a lot of potential for price to be
02:46:31.319 able to fill sell orders and we see a
02:46:34.080 move down following that showing that
02:46:35.880 sell orders have been filled what is
02:46:37.279 likely going to happen price is likely
02:46:38.920 going to move down off of that okay now
02:46:42.279 again on the contrary let's show the
02:46:45.600 bullish we're in a
02:46:47.520 downtrend we get a sweep of liquidity
02:46:49.960 and then
02:46:52.840 boom okay we get a sweep of
02:46:56.680 liquidity there's a whole bunch of sell
02:46:58.640 orders that are able to get filled
02:47:00.439 underneath this low this move down gives
02:47:04.160 price the opportunity to what fill byy
02:47:07.800 orders to cause price to change
02:47:10.080 direction we get a break of structure to
02:47:12.200 the upside confirming that we have
02:47:14.680 changeed Direction now this price range
02:47:18.120 this move down
02:47:21.760 which essentially filled all those buy
02:47:23.520 orders we have a high probability and
02:47:25.960 possibility of filling buy orders within
02:47:27.560 this price range so when price comes
02:47:30.279 back down within this price range or if
02:47:32.560 price comes back down within this price
02:47:34.120 range and then we see buy orders out of
02:47:36.080 it what is price likely going to do it's
02:47:38.439 likely going to continue
02:47:40.040 higher
02:47:41.560 now how can we identify them on the
02:47:43.920 chart another thing that I wanted to
02:47:45.840 mention order blocks can either be one
02:47:47.600 candle or or they can be two candles
02:47:49.760 they can be three candles as long as
02:47:51.279 it's consecutive so if we have oh look
02:47:55.520 pretty sweet breaking structure this is
02:47:57.000 our order block right if it's three
02:47:59.640 consecutive up candles we take it from
02:48:01.960 the bottom of the first candle to the
02:48:03.640 top of the last candle as long as it's
02:48:05.960 three consecutive up candles this can
02:48:07.640 also be considered one single up candle
02:48:09.600 it can literally just be one single up
02:48:11.000 candle with a wick that goes above this
02:48:12.520 High okay same thing to the downside it
02:48:15.000 can be two consecutive Down Candles it
02:48:17.560 can be three consecutive down candles
02:48:19.399 but what it can't be is like an up
02:48:21.760 candle and then a down candle and then
02:48:25.000 two up candles that go up to sweep out
02:48:28.120 this High these two aren't the order
02:48:30.800 block these two are because these two
02:48:32.600 are the two up candles that cause the
02:48:34.319 sweep got it cool let's go into
02:48:37.920 identifying them now and again just like
02:48:40.560 with every single other one of our
02:48:43.680 confluences this means nothing without
02:48:46.319 context let me try and find a good
02:48:48.120 example here
02:48:49.479 okay this is a good example so right
02:48:51.160 here okay we have a liquidity sweep
02:48:53.160 right liquidity sweep and again this is
02:48:55.840 a liquidity sweep to the downside and
02:48:57.399 then we see a break of structure to the
02:48:58.600 upside so we're looking for a bullish
02:49:00.319 order block right we break structure on
02:49:02.520 this candle closure right here we also
02:49:04.200 have an inverse Gap right here so
02:49:06.040 liquidity sweep inverse for Value Gap
02:49:08.479 and break for structure to the upside
02:49:09.920 cool sweep of these lows inverse for
02:49:12.279 Value Gap break of structure to the
02:49:13.319 upside where is the Candlestick that
02:49:15.720 moves down that causes the liquidity
02:49:17.359 sweep prior to the break of structure to
02:49:18.840 the upside this Candlestick right
02:49:22.319 here this is our order
02:49:25.560 block okay this move down is what caused
02:49:29.279 the liquidity sweep and it's the move
02:49:30.920 down that caused the liquidity sweep
02:49:32.200 prior to the breaking structure of the
02:49:33.200 upside so we see once we get this break
02:49:35.160 for structure to the upside price moves
02:49:36.760 down back into this order block we see
02:49:39.720 boom buy ORD is filled after that price
02:49:42.399 ends up moving higher okay let me find a
02:49:45.680 bearish example okay this is a good
02:49:47.960 example right here we get a liquidity
02:49:50.840 sweep to the upside how do we know that
02:49:52.880 it's a liquidity sweep because we end up
02:49:55.200 getting a break structure to the
02:49:56.080 downside right here we also have an
02:49:57.680 inverse bullish for Value Gap right here
02:50:00.319 we we get the inverse for Value Gap and
02:50:02.239 the break of structure at the same time
02:50:05.520 with this Candlestick closure okay we
02:50:08.680 have one two three four five up candles
02:50:12.279 this move up is what caused the
02:50:14.200 liquidity sweep so we encapsulate all of
02:50:17.160 those candles this is our order Block
02:50:19.920 it's the price range where those sell
02:50:21.920 orders were able to get filled hey
02:50:24.160 boogie you came back for more pets okay
02:50:26.239 so price moved up it swept out these
02:50:28.920 highs one two 3 four five consecutive up
02:50:32.840 candles prior to the break of structure
02:50:34.399 of the downside this is our order block
02:50:36.479 we mark it out price comes up fills in
02:50:39.359 this order block we see a down candle
02:50:41.479 and then boom price ends up going down a
02:50:43.560 lot again these mean and are nothing
02:50:47.560 without context so so don't just start
02:50:49.840 marking out order blocks and taking
02:50:51.399 trades off of them okay it needs to be
02:50:54.600 systematic it needs to be strategic and
02:50:57.000 it needs to be within the right time at
02:50:58.880 the right place okay and if we do that
02:51:01.479 incorrectly then we're
02:51:03.840 [ __ ] okay but this is a good example
02:51:06.640 of order blocks okay I want you guys to
02:51:08.720 find five examples of bullish order
02:51:11.120 blocks I want you guys to find five
02:51:13.160 examples of bearish order blocks and
02:51:15.800 then come back to me all right
02:51:18.680 I also want to show you guys an example
02:51:21.000 of or what an order block is that gets
02:51:23.279 disrespected so again an order block can
02:51:26.439 be valid as long as this is different
02:51:29.800 than fair value gaps so it's similar to
02:51:31.479 fair value gaps and that candlesticks
02:51:32.960 can close within here but it's different
02:51:35.600 with fair value gaps where price cannot
02:51:39.439 have a wick above the order block so I
02:51:42.760 mean obviously if a Candlestick closes
02:51:44.800 above the order block not only is that a
02:51:47.840 break of structure back to the upside
02:51:50.840 but it's disrespecting the order block
02:51:53.439 obviously but also we can't have a wick
02:51:57.399 above the order
02:51:59.040 block there is an exception to this
02:52:01.760 which is called an smt Divergence but in
02:52:04.960 that case we are not taking the trade
02:52:07.279 off of an order block we're taking a
02:52:08.920 trade off the smt Divergence and that's
02:52:11.279 a whole different story and we will get
02:52:12.840 into that story later after order blocks
02:52:16.840 breaker blocks and equilibrium okay so
02:52:19.000 go ahead and find five examples of order
02:52:21.279 blocks on your chart for me okay pause
02:52:24.720 this video go find five examples of
02:52:26.600 order blocks okay so once you guys have
02:52:28.760 done that we're going to go ahead and
02:52:30.200 talk about breaker blocks which are
02:52:31.880 essentially the same thing as an order
02:52:34.720 block except just a little bit different
02:52:37.800 so breaker [ __ ] breaker [ __ ] whatever
02:52:42.040 breaker blocks are the move up or down
02:52:47.800 again
02:52:49.359 to the break of structure to the up
02:52:54.880 slash downside in
02:52:58.239 Trend shift okay so breaker blocks are
02:53:01.600 they move up or move down prior to the
02:53:03.560 break of structure to the up SL downside
02:53:05.120 in Trend shift so it's literally the
02:53:06.720 same definition as an order block except
02:53:08.439 it's the opposite I guess if that makes
02:53:10.720 sense not really but look say with me
02:53:14.080 now in an uptrend okay let's say we have
02:53:16.359 an uptrend right here right
02:53:19.000 an order
02:53:20.279 block a bearish order block right is the
02:53:23.560 move up that causes the liquidity sweep
02:53:26.359 that causes the orders to be
02:53:28.279 filled now the opposite is a breaker
02:53:32.000 block a bearish breaker block is the
02:53:34.640 move
02:53:37.920 down so again most of the time it's
02:53:40.880 relatively the same price range for the
02:53:43.080 most part sometimes it's different but
02:53:45.439 for the most part It's relatively the
02:53:46.720 same price range but it's the moved down
02:53:50.120 that and the the reasoning behind this
02:53:52.439 is It's a failed retrace so typically
02:53:56.479 these retraces are what gives price the
02:53:59.640 fuel and Trends the fuel to push higher
02:54:02.359 and keep extending higher and higher and
02:54:03.960 higher so the reason that this is a a
02:54:06.160 good tool for us is because it's a
02:54:08.160 failed retrace so it's saying it caused
02:54:10.680 price to move down or sorry the the
02:54:13.040 breaker block didn't cause price to move
02:54:14.479 down but price moved down this retraced
02:54:16.800 down and then we have had buy orders
02:54:19.560 that pushed us up but to take out this
02:54:22.239 draw on liquidity we didn't have enough
02:54:25.200 buy orders to keep price pushing to keep
02:54:29.239 price to continue in the trend and then
02:54:31.120 price broke structure so order blocks
02:54:34.040 are where there's a significant where we
02:54:35.920 were able to fill a significant amount
02:54:37.680 of sell orders in the past this is
02:54:40.640 similar to fair value gaps where there's
02:54:43.120 a lack of buy orders here so order
02:54:45.800 blocks are where there was a significant
02:54:47.560 amount of sell orders that were able to
02:54:49.080 get filled within that price range this
02:54:51.439 is there is a lack of buy orders that
02:54:54.239 were filled because why like we weren't
02:54:56.520 able to fill enough buy orders to
02:54:57.920 continue the trend higher So within this
02:54:59.680 price range because there's a lack of
02:55:01.640 buy orders similar to fair value gaps if
02:55:03.560 we get in here and we F fill sell orders
02:55:06.239 price is going to move down again with
02:55:07.760 the right context and confluences now
02:55:10.880 same thing to the upside okay so if
02:55:12.840 we're in a
02:55:14.720 downtrend that was horrible
02:55:19.479 if we're in a downtrend this order block
02:55:22.319 right here right this moved down it gave
02:55:26.120 us the ability to fill a significant
02:55:29.200 amount of buy orders right so this price
02:55:31.279 range is where we were able to fill a
02:55:32.800 significant amount of buy orders the
02:55:34.640 opposite is this breaker block this move
02:55:38.239 up this retrace that failed to fill the
02:55:41.439 amount of sell orders required for us to
02:55:43.960 get a full extension and continue this
02:55:46.520 downtrend so what is there within here a
02:55:49.000 lack of sell orders so if price comes
02:55:51.960 back and retraces within this
02:55:54.680 Confluence and gives us buy orders out
02:55:56.840 of it and how do we see buy orders just
02:55:58.560 byy a candle up by the way I don't think
02:56:00.479 I mentioned that we are likely going to
02:56:02.000 see price continue
02:56:03.720 up now let's Show an example of this on
02:56:06.080 the chart this okay so look right here
02:56:09.800 okay we get a break structure to the
02:56:11.000 downside right we don't have to go
02:56:12.439 through all the steps but we get a
02:56:13.840 breaking structure to the downside let's
02:56:15.439 practice both order blocks and breaker
02:56:16.840 blocks so where's our order block or
02:56:18.279 quar block these two up candles right
02:56:20.680 the up candles that cause a liquidity
02:56:22.040 sweep where's our breaker block the down
02:56:25.080 candle the retrace prior or the Down
02:56:28.200 Candles because it can be
02:56:30.640 multiple prior to price breaking
02:56:33.080 structure and prior to the liquidity
02:56:35.200 sweep so in this case price doesn't hit
02:56:38.160 the order block but what does it fill it
02:56:40.600 fills the breaker block then following
02:56:42.960 that price ends up moving down okay we
02:56:45.880 actually just formed or after these 11
02:56:48.439 minutes go by will actually form a good
02:56:50.600 example of this again on both of these
02:56:52.840 so look we get a break of structure to
02:56:54.760 the upside we already broke structure to
02:56:56.080 the upside we haven't officially
02:56:57.960 confirmed this yet once this candle
02:57:00.120 closes bullish then it'll show that
02:57:01.920 we're respecting these but we have the
02:57:03.600 candles down that caused the liquidity
02:57:05.319 sweep this is what our order block and
02:57:07.720 then we have the up candle prior to the
02:57:09.680 liquidity sweep and prior to the break
02:57:11.479 of structure that is our breaker
02:57:14.359 block okay let's uh show another example
02:57:18.479 of both of
02:57:19.880 these hopefully you guys are getting
02:57:22.080 good at this again I want you guys to be
02:57:23.720 able to see these and notice these like
02:57:26.160 the back of your [ __ ] hand this is a
02:57:28.160 good example of only a breaker block
02:57:30.840 getting filled we get a break structure
02:57:32.520 to the upside right here okay where is
02:57:35.040 our order Block it's this down candle
02:57:37.200 right here where is our breaker Block
02:57:39.960 it's this up candle prior to the
02:57:41.920 liquidity sweep which one gets filled
02:57:44.200 the breaker blocks get there's a move
02:57:46.200 down into the breaker block it gets
02:57:47.479 filled bullish out a bit boom price ends
02:57:49.920 up moving higher now again I know I keep
02:57:52.120 saying this but these confluences really
02:57:54.359 do mean nothing without context so again
02:57:57.200 if you guys see a breaker block or an
02:57:58.800 order block get formed I don't want you
02:58:00.600 guys just blindly going in and taking
02:58:03.120 trades off of these things because you
02:58:05.600 will end up losing but we are so close
02:58:08.359 we're literally two confluences away
02:58:10.920 from having everything that we need to
02:58:12.359 know in order to take profitable trades
02:58:14.439 at the right time on the right time
02:58:16.120 frames and to be able to read price
02:58:17.840 action for what it is okay we are so
02:58:20.399 [ __ ] close we are almost there all
02:58:22.560 right so [ __ ] close let's do our
02:58:25.399 homework of marking out five order
02:58:27.600 blocks in each Direction and let's do
02:58:29.239 our homework of marking out five breaker
02:58:31.040 blocks in each Direction and now let's
02:58:33.279 get into equilibrium which is another
02:58:35.560 one of our continuation confluences okay
02:58:37.760 so order block and breaker blocks as you
02:58:39.720 guessed are continuation confluences
02:58:42.720 okay these are continuation confluences
02:58:44.920 why because we get a liquidity sweep
02:58:47.359 first we get a break of structure a
02:58:49.720 change of Direction a change of the
02:58:51.399 current Trend that we're in and then we
02:58:53.200 see price continue the trend off of
02:58:57.000 these confluences off of these
02:58:59.680 patterns okay so next is going to be
02:59:03.520 equilibrium equilibrium is going to be
02:59:05.720 another continuation Confluence and then
02:59:09.239 smt is a confirmation Confluence and
02:59:13.040 then from there we will be able to put
02:59:14.880 all of this [ __ ] together and teach you
02:59:17.120 guys how how to take profitable trades
02:59:20.319 and I'm super excited to do that so
02:59:21.960 let's get into equilibrium all right
02:59:23.840 sorry I started the next lesson without
02:59:25.760 even pressing record equilibrium what is
02:59:28.239 it why do we need it why do we want it
02:59:30.880 why is it amazing for us equilibrium
02:59:33.399 essentially marks the 50% mark from
02:59:38.000 highs down to lows or lows up to
02:59:41.399 highs within retracements and listen I
02:59:45.560 could explain the complete brand riac
02:59:49.439 really awesome really long and thought
02:59:52.239 out
02:59:53.600 explanation for why equilibrium is
02:59:56.479 beneficial but I honestly there's just
02:59:59.720 no real reason to do that so as long as
03:00:03.680 you just can see this [ __ ] work in
03:00:05.560 action that's all that we need to know
03:00:07.680 so equilibrium is the 50% Mark just know
03:00:11.479 that price more often than not if it's
03:00:14.439 retracing off this 50% Mark or if it's
03:00:17.560 reac off this 50% mark from swing low up
03:00:20.200 to swing high or from swing High down to
03:00:22.840 swing low depending on what trend we're
03:00:24.479 in and again I'm going to show you guys
03:00:26.080 how to mark this out on the chart
03:00:27.319 obviously but that's all that you guys
03:00:29.399 got to know it equilibrium is the 50%
03:00:33.120 mark from the most recent high slash
03:00:39.359 low to the most
03:00:41.920 recent low again and that's depending on
03:00:46.319 what trend we're in so let's draw this
03:00:48.399 out again this is a continuation
03:00:50.399 Confluence so if we're in an
03:00:53.160 uptrend how do we Mark out equilibrium
03:00:55.600 first of all what tool do we use to Mark
03:00:57.319 out equ equilibrium with this is one of
03:00:59.479 the first times that we're actually
03:01:00.720 going to be using one of these tools one
03:01:03.239 of the first and only times that we're
03:01:04.760 going to be using one of these tools
03:01:06.080 actually okay the tool that I like to
03:01:08.040 use for this is the Gan boox okay so in
03:01:11.640 an uptrend when we're trying to find
03:01:13.520 bullish
03:01:15.800 equilibrium we use the Gan ball box and
03:01:18.319 I'll go ahead you guys can go ahead and
03:01:19.920 copy my settings
03:01:27.279 here y get those settings nice and good
03:01:31.760 buddy okay so when we're drawing
03:01:33.920 equilibrium bullish equilibrium so let's
03:01:36.359 say we're in an uptrend or we're trying
03:01:38.399 to find a continuation Confluence to the
03:01:40.239 upside say there's no for Value gaps
03:01:42.439 there's no order blocks there's no
03:01:43.520 breaker blocks Last Resort equilibrium
03:01:46.200 cool we draw it from the low
03:01:48.640 the most recent low up to the most
03:01:50.920 recent high and if price comes down
03:01:54.359 underneath this 50% mark because this
03:01:57.479 pretty much measures the extension and
03:02:00.800 and gives us the 50% Mark of the
03:02:04.319 extension showing us where discounted
03:02:06.720 price is and where premium price is more
03:02:09.080 often than not or it's just known that
03:02:12.000 if price moves into a discount let's
03:02:14.439 just think about this if your
03:02:16.840 favorite Cheeto puff or I know some of
03:02:20.439 you [ __ ] idiots are going to be like
03:02:22.359 I don't like Cheeto puffs like okay fine
03:02:25.319 what does everybody like every Everybody
03:02:27.720 Needs water let's just do [ __ ] water
03:02:30.200 well no because there's cheaper water
03:02:32.120 God [ __ ] damn it everybody likes ice
03:02:34.520 cream and if I hear somebody talking
03:02:36.760 about I don't like ice cream in the
03:02:39.040 comments [ __ ] you okay this is the
03:02:41.880 example that I'm using imagine you like
03:02:44.080 ice cream and imagine your favorite ice
03:02:48.520 cream that you buy is worth
03:03:10.080 $23,170
03:03:13.800 1857 are you going to buy it duh CZ
03:03:18.120 you're fat as [ __ ] you're gonna buy that
03:03:22.359 [ __ ] right there it's the same thing
03:03:24.760 with the markets if we're in an uptrend
03:03:27.560 and when we get retraces into discounted
03:03:30.439 prices so this all this does is it helps
03:03:32.920 us measure from the start of an
03:03:35.120 extension to the top of an extension to
03:03:37.840 measure out where do we start getting
03:03:39.680 discounted prices within this uptrend
03:03:42.520 underneath this 50% Mark the 50% Mark is
03:03:45.760 equilibrium because it's in between
03:03:47.840 premium and a discount okay this this
03:03:49.720 line is showing the premium and the
03:03:53.080 discount okay so if we push into a
03:03:56.279 discounted price range and market makers
03:03:58.359 F buy orders because that's optim right
03:04:00.640 it's a cheap price what's going to
03:04:02.720 happen price is probably going to move
03:04:04.000 higher that's all it is it's all it is
03:04:06.359 probably one of the easiest confluences
03:04:07.920 to learn people still somehow find a way
03:04:10.479 to [ __ ] it up and I'm going to show you
03:04:12.600 ways that people [ __ ] it up in a
03:04:14.439 downtrend we take it from the high down
03:04:16.479 to the low so that actually won't hit
03:04:19.640 equilibrium let me redraw
03:04:23.479 this okay equilibrium we take it from
03:04:26.040 the most recent
03:04:27.720 High down to the most recent
03:04:30.560 low and now when when we're looking for
03:04:33.399 sells right we want price to be at a
03:04:36.359 premium and we want to sell it at a
03:04:39.080 discount right so when price pushes up
03:04:42.399 into a premium and we say I ain't paying
03:04:45.279 for that [ __ ] ice cream
03:04:48.640 and I know damn well nobody else is
03:04:50.279 paying for that [ __ ] ice cream I'm
03:04:51.840 going to short this [ __ ] the market
03:04:53.640 makers they say [ __ ] that [ __ ] we're
03:04:55.960 tanking it boom they enter into sell
03:04:58.640 positions at a discounted price we see
03:05:01.800 that price is likely going to move
03:05:04.479 down now how do you not Mark out
03:05:07.840 equilibrium I know it sounds stupid
03:05:10.080 because I just explained it to you but
03:05:11.399 retards will do some [ __ ] like this take
03:05:14.720 it from this random ass High down to
03:05:17.200 this random Mass low is this the most
03:05:19.040 recent high that was made no is this the
03:05:21.399 most recent low that was made no what
03:05:23.840 else will retards do well we're in a
03:05:25.960 downtrend and they'll say okay well you
03:05:27.760 take it from the most recent high and
03:05:29.160 low that was made well this was a high
03:05:30.760 that was made and this was the low that
03:05:32.800 was made but what why isn't it getting
03:05:35.920 hit well
03:05:37.439 idiot you draw it from this high down to
03:05:41.680 this
03:05:42.439 low okay not from this high back in time
03:05:46.560 down to this low once we make a new low
03:05:49.560 right here then we can take it from this
03:05:52.080 high down to this low how do we identify
03:05:54.760 highs and lows within the market with a
03:05:56.880 move up and then a move down how do we
03:05:59.840 identify a low within the market a move
03:06:01.960 down then a move up okay pretty simple
03:06:06.439 let's go onto the chart and let's look
03:06:09.760 at this [ __ ] let's literally look at the
03:06:12.160 most recent thing that we saw break your
03:06:14.279 structure to the upside what are we now
03:06:15.640 in uptrend motion
03:06:18.960 let's look for a continuation Confluence
03:06:20.800 oh my God would you look at that it hit
03:06:22.520 equilibrium I'm going to jack off and
03:06:24.200 then nut all over the screen and it's
03:06:25.640 all so sticky tjr please wipe it off of
03:06:27.840 me and then do it again oh it's in my
03:06:30.520 eyes I can't see please leave your Gan
03:06:32.960 box on I want to see it most recent low
03:06:36.840 what's a low move down then move up up
03:06:39.040 to the most recent High move up then
03:06:41.200 move
03:06:43.319 down okay equilibrium right here we get
03:06:46.760 a break St start to the downside we're
03:06:48.439 looking for a continuation Confluence
03:06:50.520 from the high move up then to move down
03:06:52.160 is this the high right here is this the
03:06:54.359 high yes tjr it is the high good boy
03:06:57.000 Timmy psych you're an idiot no it's not
03:06:59.000 the high move up then a move down come
03:07:01.319 on wow I almost called you the
03:07:04.279 fur we are getting we're getting deep
03:07:08.000 into this I think I can start letting
03:07:09.800 things rip a little bit because if
03:07:11.479 you're going to [ __ ] with me for this
03:07:13.080 long then that means you were going to
03:07:15.040 [ __ ] me at the beginning anyways because
03:07:17.080 at the beginning I I already said a
03:07:18.720 whole bunch of [ __ ] so if you stuck
03:07:20.319 around for this long I can I can say
03:07:22.800 whatever I want at this point move up
03:07:24.960 then move down low move down then move
03:07:28.120 up lowest point of those two candles
03:07:29.880 highest point of these two candles and
03:07:31.920 bang we got our equilibrium price moves
03:07:34.640 into a
03:07:36.080 premium we see a down candle out of it
03:07:39.359 Bear Run
03:07:41.399 [ __ ] simple as that bro simple as
03:07:44.800 that now remember what what is not
03:07:51.200 equilibrium that is not equilibrium why
03:07:53.640 because this is a random ass low this is
03:07:55.479 a random ass High don't do that I know
03:07:58.560 it sounds crazy but retards do that bet
03:08:01.800 bro we just slimed out equilibrium from
03:08:06.399 these lows up to these highs like what
03:08:08.200 bro that does not make any sense no most
03:08:10.960 recent low up to the most recent High
03:08:12.640 most recent High down to the most recent
03:08:14.359 low plain and simple cold heart facts
03:08:17.479 cold heart Stacks cold heart rats we got
03:08:20.439 equilibrium homework Mark out five cases
03:08:23.840 of bullish equilibrium Mark out five
03:08:25.640 cases of bearish equilibrium I know just
03:08:28.160 like all the other confluences I feel
03:08:29.720 like I say this over and over and over
03:08:30.960 and over and over and over and over
03:08:32.080 again but just like all of our other
03:08:34.200 confluences this does not mean [ __ ]
03:08:37.600 without context and without being used
03:08:40.359 in the right situation it's like a gun
03:08:42.680 okay a gun is super useful but without
03:08:45.279 the right context and in the wrong and
03:08:47.800 in the wrong
03:08:49.080 situation you're going to [ __ ] jail
03:08:51.720 okay I can't walk down the street just
03:08:53.960 [ __ ] firing off rounds into the sky
03:08:57.560 but if I'm in the middle if I'm in the
03:08:59.439 middle of like a [ __ ] gun whatever
03:09:02.359 like a [ __ ] shooting range not a
03:09:05.120 shooting range if I'm in like the
03:09:06.600 [ __ ] Forest hunting I can probably
03:09:09.399 let a couple [ __ ] fly to the upside
03:09:12.439 probably not the smartest idea but maybe
03:09:15.399 I will may actually I don't know the
03:09:17.399 regulations on that someone be fact
03:09:19.160 check me but you get what I'm saying we
03:09:22.040 can't just be firing off buys and sells
03:09:24.359 off of equilibrium like Daddy tjr taught
03:09:26.840 me this I'm going to make you a
03:09:27.800 billionaire no daddy he's going to make
03:09:30.279 you
03:09:31.040 broke okay he is definitely going to
03:09:33.640 make you broke don't listen to him again
03:09:36.000 this is this only works within the right
03:09:39.040 context okay so we need
03:09:41.840 context before we have sex the last and
03:09:46.439 well I was going say the most important
03:09:48.520 but it's not but hey hey don't discredit
03:09:51.319 this [ __ ] though don't discredit this
03:09:52.880 [ __ ] though the last Confluence that you
03:09:55.200 guys have to learn and be fluent in in
03:09:58.239 order to understand the markets um is
03:10:00.399 smt Divergence okay or smt
03:10:05.120 diverence okay now something that I want
03:10:08.239 to mention just right now if you guys
03:10:12.239 are Forex Traders so if you guys are
03:10:14.880 trading gbpusd
03:10:18.000 Euro USD gold okay if you guys are
03:10:21.160 trading any anything besides the S&P 500
03:10:25.120 in NASDAQ this is not going to apply to
03:10:27.680 you but don't leave the [ __ ] video
03:10:30.120 okay don't leave the video because I
03:10:31.520 have to show you how to use all these
03:10:32.920 confluences together because right now
03:10:34.840 you guys are freaking clueless okay you
03:10:37.359 guys are just taking trades on who knows
03:10:39.760 what right now and you guys just have
03:10:41.800 all these confluences but don't know how
03:10:43.560 to put them together so you guys fast
03:10:46.319 forward through the smt Divergence or
03:10:48.120 just sit back relax and watch it to see
03:10:50.399 if you know you maybe want to switch
03:10:51.880 over to indexes anytime maybe take notes
03:10:54.760 on it why don't you but this this only
03:10:57.239 applies to indexes and I'm going to
03:10:58.920 explain why so what are smt divergences
03:11:03.279 just realized my mic was down sorry if
03:11:06.000 I'm now way louder than before and you
03:11:09.319 raise your volume um but smt
03:11:12.720 divergences what are they why do we use
03:11:15.200 them so again let me put only on indexes
03:11:19.960 so only on the S&P 500 in NASDAQ okay
03:11:23.439 and not only is it only on the S&P 500
03:11:25.640 and NASDAQ NASDAQ smoking out of your
03:11:27.640 ass crack okay well no it is only on
03:11:30.880 those but okay lock in it is when
03:11:34.600 one index
03:11:37.720 makes a higher high while the other
03:11:43.120 makes a lower high I think I SP spelled
03:11:47.479 that right I didn't I knew I didn't God
03:11:50.239 damn it and
03:11:52.190 [Music]
03:11:54.200 one lower low the other
03:11:59.120 makes so you're probably saying like
03:12:01.560 what the [ __ ] are you talking about tjr
03:12:03.439 I don't get it when one index makes a
03:12:05.720 higher high but then the other one makes
03:12:07.359 a lower high like bro what but then when
03:12:10.239 one index makes a lower low and the
03:12:11.880 other one makes a higher low you're
03:12:13.640 talking about Trends bro you're like on
03:12:16.239 some like weird like on some like on
03:12:19.000 some like [ __ ] bro listen bro listen
03:12:23.000 just listen to me bro and then bro just
03:12:25.880 the source just trust me bro anyways
03:12:29.319 let's lock it smt Divergence typically
03:12:32.399 when I explain this people get confused
03:12:34.439 I don't know why to me it makes complete
03:12:36.720 sense but maybe that's just because
03:12:38.880 everybody's a beginner in this and we
03:12:40.239 all learn at our at our own slow but
03:12:43.120 sure Pace I'll try and explain this in
03:12:45.439 the best way possible let's say say the
03:12:47.920 S&P 500 is in an
03:12:52.120 uptrend
03:12:54.600 okay the S&P 500 is in an uptrend this
03:12:58.399 this trend line or yeah Trend shows the
03:13:02.560 S&P 500 okay and since the S&P 500 and
03:13:07.080 NASDAQ are correlated indexes meaning
03:13:10.279 when the S&P 500 goes up typically the
03:13:12.840 NASDAQ goes up when the S&P 500 goes
03:13:15.399 down typically the NASDAQ goes down okay
03:13:20.120 so if the S&P 500 is making an uptrend
03:13:23.880 then the NASDAQ is making an
03:13:28.040 uptrend okay but what happens when we
03:13:30.880 have something like this where the S&P
03:13:34.399 500 is in an uptrend and makes a higher
03:13:37.600 high but then
03:13:39.600 NASDAQ is in an uptrend doesn't break
03:13:42.640 structure doesn't get an inverse for
03:13:44.160 Value Gap but just gives us a high a
03:13:46.479 lower high that is what we call an smt
03:13:51.279 smt Divergence it's when one index is
03:13:55.080 lagging behind the other and
03:13:58.359 typically this happens at key levels
03:14:01.920 such as draws on
03:14:04.439 liquidity okay so what typically happens
03:14:08.120 with this is the S&P 500 it's moving up
03:14:12.319 it's in an uptrend and then let's say we
03:14:14.640 have a drawn liquidity right here a high
03:14:17.840 time frame High we have a high time
03:14:19.960 frame High not only on the S&P 500 but
03:14:22.319 also on NASDAQ sure the S&P 500 pushes
03:14:25.600 above that high but it still continues
03:14:27.760 this uptrend and it hasn't given us
03:14:29.720 there's no break of structure there's no
03:14:31.160 inverse for Value Gap there's nothing
03:14:33.520 telling us that price is going to go
03:14:34.920 down yet but on NASDAQ we're seeing the
03:14:38.479 same uptrend but hey what's that NASDAQ
03:14:41.720 is making a lower high signaling a sign
03:14:44.560 of weakness signaling a potential sign
03:14:46.880 of of a reversal but the S&P 500 is
03:14:50.439 moving in higher highs what is that
03:14:52.720 telling me about the S&P 500 the s&p500
03:14:55.479 is lagging behind NASDAQ why because
03:14:58.840 NASDAQ just pushed up into a key level
03:15:01.720 and is now making a lower high giving me
03:15:03.880 signs of a reversal and if NASDAQ
03:15:06.520 continues down into a downtrend then
03:15:10.000 obviously a reversal had happened so we
03:15:12.680 will know that typically like when we're
03:15:15.120 right here on NASDAQ that's Ty typically
03:15:17.239 when we're like right here on the S&P
03:15:18.720 500 so NASDAQ may have already broke its
03:15:21.120 structure may have already given us an
03:15:22.680 inverse for Value Gap but the S&P is
03:15:24.960 lagging because its price was just
03:15:26.960 behind and it literally helps us tell
03:15:29.439 the future of what the other index is
03:15:31.080 going to do so when we see an smt
03:15:32.680 Divergence in this case this is a
03:15:34.840 bearish smt Divergence a bearish smt
03:15:38.319 Divergence is when one index it doesn't
03:15:40.439 matter which one okay this one could be
03:15:43.120 NASDAQ this one could be S&P 500 it
03:15:46.040 doesn't matter which one is making the
03:15:47.520 higher high and which one is making the
03:15:48.960 lower high cuz it it applies both ways
03:15:52.840 so let's say this one's NASDAQ NASDAQ is
03:15:55.720 making higher Highs but the S&P 500 is
03:15:58.640 making a lower high off of a key level
03:16:01.040 and is moving down that is a sign for me
03:16:04.520 to look at NASDAQ and say how can I find
03:16:09.560 a short trade how can I find a trade to
03:16:11.560 go lower why because NASDAQ is literally
03:16:14.520 telling us exactly what's about to
03:16:16.359 happen to the S&P 500 because what is
03:16:18.800 about to happen to the S&P 500 just
03:16:21.239 happened on NASDAQ and has already
03:16:23.399 happened on NASDAQ and NASDAQ is telling
03:16:25.120 us the future of what's about to happen
03:16:27.040 on the S&P 500 now it's the same thing
03:16:29.960 when it's in the opposite direction so
03:16:32.239 let's say we're in a downtrend and we
03:16:34.040 have a key level right here we're in
03:16:35.960 downtrend whatever we're making lower
03:16:37.880 lows and lower highs let's say this is
03:16:40.520 the S&P 500 and let's say need to make
03:16:43.840 sure I draw this correctly okay let's
03:16:46.600 say this is the S&P 500 where we're
03:16:48.920 making lower lows still we're continuing
03:16:50.800 the downtrend but this one's NASDAQ we
03:16:53.439 make a higher low again we don't have a
03:16:55.479 break of structure we don't have an
03:16:56.560 invers for Value Gap but we do have a
03:16:59.479 higher low what is NASDAQ telling us
03:17:02.319 about the s&p500 it's saying that hey
03:17:05.160 NASDAQ is actually moving higher already
03:17:07.960 off of this impact key level and the S&P
03:17:11.399 500 is about to [ __ ] follow suit and
03:17:14.760 it's about to go higher just like NASDAQ
03:17:16.920 is already going higher so a bullish smt
03:17:20.000 Divergence is when one index is making
03:17:22.560 lower lows while the other index is
03:17:24.720 making higher lows now again just like
03:17:27.160 with every single other Confluence that
03:17:29.520 I've taught you guys about the [ __ ] is
03:17:31.680 he doing over there you're literally
03:17:33.359 sniffing my ass Boogie get your head out
03:17:36.560 of my butt anyways just like every
03:17:39.560 single other Confluence that I've taught
03:17:41.720 you guys about this means nothing
03:17:43.960 without context and the key thing with
03:17:46.239 smts the biggest context clue that we
03:17:48.960 need with smts is a key level because we
03:17:51.960 see smt divergences happen all the time
03:17:55.160 in the chart just because NASDAQ and the
03:17:56.920 S&P 500 they just straight up they just
03:17:59.040 move differently so if we're again just
03:18:01.080 taking Longs purely off of NASDAQ making
03:18:03.560 a a higher low and Es making uh a lower
03:18:07.319 low we're going to we're going to lose
03:18:09.479 trades but when we're using it as a as a
03:18:13.000 Confluence after coming into a key level
03:18:15.160 and then putting it together which is
03:18:17.000 exactly what we're about to do after I
03:18:18.439 show you guys examples of this on the
03:18:20.479 chart then it's actually a very very
03:18:24.080 very good Confluence for us to use so
03:18:26.760 let's Show an example of this on the
03:18:27.960 chart there was actually a very good
03:18:29.399 example of this yesterday so I'm going
03:18:30.960 to show it beautiful example of this
03:18:33.840 yesterday so this is going to be giving
03:18:35.920 us a little sneak peek into you know
03:18:39.359 potentially some what the strategy looks
03:18:42.000 like a bit but we're at the point now
03:18:43.800 where we understand all the confluences
03:18:45.359 so what am I marking out here this is a
03:18:47.120 bearish fair value Gap we're currently
03:18:48.760 in an hourly downtrend this is Market
03:18:50.840 open for New York St New York Stock
03:18:52.479 Exchange
03:18:56.000 okay so let's look here on the S&P 500
03:18:59.760 okay Market opens what are we in we're
03:19:01.319 in a downtrend right we have a low right
03:19:03.560 here a high right here a lower low a
03:19:05.560 lower high cool we're in a downtrend
03:19:07.319 coming in Market open okay on
03:19:11.520 NASDAQ see what we got
03:19:14.760 here when the S&P 5 00 is making a lower
03:19:19.680 high NASDAQ is making a higher high so
03:19:23.160 we can see that it's literally happening
03:19:24.720 happening at the exact same time
03:19:28.120 935
03:19:30.160 935 the S&P 500 makes a lower
03:19:34.279 high while NASDAQ is making a higher
03:19:38.359 high so when this happens we know that
03:19:41.279 this is a bearish
03:19:43.080 Confluence and we know that that means
03:19:45.840 NASDAQ is lagging index why is NASDAQ
03:19:48.560 the lagging index because it made a
03:19:50.840 higher high while the S&P 5 500 made a
03:19:54.279 lower high so why are we going to want
03:19:56.960 to take our trade on NASDAQ because it's
03:19:58.720 lagging behind the S&P and the S&P is
03:20:00.520 going to tell us literally exactly where
03:20:02.120 nasdaq's going to go following that we
03:20:04.920 can go through every single one of our
03:20:07.199 steps to be able to execute a trade and
03:20:09.760 catch a banger short which I was able to
03:20:12.399 catch I made $25,000 on this trade don't
03:20:15.120 believe me go look at the trade recap
03:20:17.640 that I posted of me making $25,000 in a
03:20:20.960 day and it it was posted recently like
03:20:23.720 last week so go watch it as long as
03:20:26.359 you're seeing this video as it came out
03:20:27.880 obviously but that's smt Divergence in
03:20:32.040 the wild now let me try and find an
03:20:35.000 example of
03:20:37.319 uh bullish smt
03:20:40.160 Divergence it's been hard to find
03:20:42.199 bullish smt Divergence it's been a
03:20:44.520 minute actually for us to be able to
03:20:46.479 find fine bullish smt Divergence just
03:20:48.120 because price action has been so bad
03:20:50.439 recently it's going to be around Market
03:20:52.600 opens but again these Market opens have
03:20:54.279 been so bearish recently man I wonder if
03:20:57.520 I can just show you guys one on the high
03:20:59.359 time frames cuz low time frames it's
03:21:00.840 really going to take forever oh this was
03:21:03.040 a high time frame one I believe okay so
03:21:06.239 this is again all of our confluences
03:21:08.840 happen on every single time frame that's
03:21:10.439 the awesome way about how we trade so
03:21:12.199 again even though this is on a high time
03:21:14.399 frame and we're not necessarily looking
03:21:15.840 at execution here we can see how this
03:21:17.720 still applies NASDAQ we have a low right
03:21:21.239 here okay first of all we're in a
03:21:22.520 downtrend right so we're expecting to
03:21:23.880 make lower lows and lower highs right we
03:21:25.560 have a low right here technically we
03:21:27.080 should be on like the daily time frame
03:21:28.600 because there's a whole bunch of like
03:21:30.319 lows and stuff within here but you guys
03:21:32.120 can visualize it by now at least I hope
03:21:34.720 okay we have a low right here and then a
03:21:36.160 higher low right here okay we can see
03:21:38.239 that this is a higher low on the s&p500
03:21:41.359 however we have the same low right here
03:21:44.399 followed by a lower low
03:21:47.760 so what is NASDAQ telling us about the
03:21:49.640 S&P 500 it's saying hey buddy you better
03:21:52.000 start looking for buys right here
03:21:54.279 because you are lagging behind the
03:21:56.399 NASDAQ and the nasdaq's moving up and
03:21:58.920 it's moving higher and it's moving quick
03:22:01.040 so you better get on the [ __ ] train
03:22:02.760 and you better find a [ __ ] entry
03:22:05.080 right the [ __ ] now and then boom both
03:22:07.640 prices end
03:22:10.560 up going higher simple simple [ __ ] now
03:22:15.199 that we understand literally everything
03:22:18.680 this is the big one we are going to put
03:22:20.880 this strategy together I'm going to tell
03:22:23.399 you guys how we put all these
03:22:25.479 confluences together explain how we do
03:22:27.279 it on the chart and then I'm going to
03:22:29.560 leave you guys with some risk management
03:22:32.319 tools okay show you guys how we can go
03:22:35.640 over news data a little bit okay tell
03:22:40.000 you guys what news to avoid okay also
03:22:42.560 how to calculate your risk when entering
03:22:45.120 into a trades and then I'm going to give
03:22:46.960 you guys a little mindset lesson at the
03:22:48.920 very end so please stay tuned to that
03:22:50.760 because not only do you have to be super
03:22:53.199 good and super fluent in the charts on
03:22:56.080 like strategy wise but if your risk
03:22:58.120 management is not in check you will lose
03:23:01.680 money forever in the markets and I
03:23:03.920 promise you that coming from somebody
03:23:05.640 that was exactly in your position just a
03:23:07.399 couple years ago my big the biggest
03:23:09.399 mistakes that I ever made was actually
03:23:11.359 not when it came to chartwork my
03:23:13.239 chartwork was Immaculate my chart workor
03:23:15.160 was really really good however the
03:23:17.239 biggest struggle that I had when trying
03:23:19.120 to learn how to day trade was protecting
03:23:21.399 my mental fixing my emotions and fix
03:23:24.880 fixing my risk management so we need I I
03:23:27.479 could cut this video short right after I
03:23:29.640 show you guys the strategy and be like
03:23:31.319 boom now go throw your life savings on
03:23:33.600 it I'm not going to do that for you guys
03:23:35.479 I'm going to teach you guys how to risk
03:23:37.040 properly I'm also going to teach you
03:23:38.760 guys how to get your mind in check okay
03:23:41.040 and if you guys can do all three of
03:23:43.399 these things Master strategy within the
03:23:45.920 market master Master risk within the
03:23:47.319 market and master psychology within the
03:23:48.960 market I can promise you that along with
03:23:52.239 time on the charts and just doing this
03:23:54.160 over and over and over again because
03:23:55.479 it's one thing to sit here and watch
03:23:57.399 this YouTube video and be like yes I
03:23:59.199 understand yes I understand and to
03:24:00.439 digest the information and there's been
03:24:01.920 a lot of information that I've thrown at
03:24:03.600 you but you have to take that
03:24:06.399 information and then you have to go and
03:24:07.800 [ __ ] apply it so if you're able to do
03:24:10.439 all of that then you're going to be on a
03:24:12.600 great path but if you just sit here and
03:24:14.640 watch this video and then don't do
03:24:16.399 anything after that you're not going to
03:24:18.199 be able to do [ __ ] or if you just sit
03:24:19.720 there watch this video Don't Journal
03:24:21.760 don't try and get your mind right don't
03:24:23.120 use proper risk management you're going
03:24:24.439 to be screwed and then you're going to
03:24:25.560 be in my comment section saying tjr this
03:24:27.239 doesn't work but I was able to make
03:24:29.120 $40,000 and the week isn't even over
03:24:31.319 it's [ __ ] Wednesday of this week but
03:24:33.880 you're telling me that the strategy that
03:24:35.359 I'm teaching you doesn't work something
03:24:37.880 something doesn't align here what's the
03:24:39.920 missing variable it's you and the work
03:24:42.399 that you have yet to put in so now that
03:24:45.760 we got you all riled up let's get into
03:24:48.840 how we can put all this together to
03:24:50.520 actually take good trades within the
03:24:52.880 market welcome to the final strategy
03:24:57.359 everything that you guys have been
03:24:58.520 learning up until now can finally be be
03:25:01.439 be put together in one simple squash
03:25:05.720 it's like
03:25:06.720 guacamole you get the avocado you plop
03:25:09.439 it in there you get the salsa you throw
03:25:12.000 it in there you get the onions boom you
03:25:14.279 give a little lime squeeze you get some
03:25:16.520 garlic in there maybe some salt maybe
03:25:19.439 some Peppa steppa okay maybe your mom's
03:25:24.279 maybe maybe toss a mango in that [ __ ]
03:25:27.840 right spice may maybe you never know a
03:25:30.840 little pomegranate I know they like
03:25:32.479 tossing them pomegranates in the
03:25:33.840 guacamole we have all these ingredients
03:25:36.840 but we haven't mashed it together yet we
03:25:39.439 haven't mashed it and once and once we
03:25:43.120 start
03:25:44.399 mashing that's when the magic happens
03:25:46.680 baby right here right here is when the
03:25:48.600 magic
03:25:50.040 happens the mashing is when the magic
03:25:52.680 happens so I need you guys to lock in I
03:25:56.000 know you guys are reading this and be
03:25:57.479 like D I'm going to write it down cuz
03:25:59.520 this is billion dollar secret tjr is
03:26:02.319 billion dollar secret is live guys I
03:26:04.960 waited 10 hours for this listen timy I'm
03:26:08.439 telling you right now you're not you're
03:26:11.279 not going to turn profitable if you just
03:26:13.600 take this and run to the markets is
03:26:16.439 going to take a lot of practice you guys
03:26:18.439 need to do this on a demo account cuz I
03:26:20.319 promise you just like this is just
03:26:23.439 before we get into the strategy portion
03:26:25.239 because I know you guys have been
03:26:26.760 waiting for this I need to edge you guys
03:26:28.439 a little bit more okay I need to tickle
03:26:30.560 you guys I need to play with you guys I
03:26:33.000 love you guys and let's just play
03:26:35.479 together I I want to invite you guys
03:26:36.920 over to my house for a play dat and then
03:26:38.680 maybe we can just sit and read books and
03:26:40.399 play all day but I also want to tell you
03:26:43.680 guys something this is similar I'm like
03:26:47.560 LeBron okay I'm I'm
03:26:51.319 65 you know he's
03:26:53.640 67 I'm good at basketball he's good at
03:26:56.840 basketball he's black I'm black I want
03:27:00.479 to be black you know we're like the same
03:27:02.760 dude pretty much but if LeBron made a
03:27:05.760 course or gave you guys TR basketball
03:27:08.239 training videos right and you guys were
03:27:11.199 to sit down if he gave you guys like an
03:27:13.199 8 hour 10 hour whatever basketball
03:27:15.160 training video you sit down and you
03:27:17.000 watch it and you're like yep I
03:27:18.399 understand I understand I understand and
03:27:20.319 then you guys go and hit the black top
03:27:22.239 and then you try and apply everything
03:27:24.199 that big daddy Braun told you guys about
03:27:26.680 in those trading videos and then after
03:27:28.840 the first day you miss every single shot
03:27:31.239 you suck at dribbling you suck at
03:27:32.640 passing your IQ is [ __ ] do you go to Big
03:27:35.359 Daddy braa and say yo bro what the [ __ ]
03:27:38.439 you suck at basketball you're a [ __ ]
03:27:40.239 liar you're a [ __ ]
03:27:41.840 scammer no you look at yourself and say
03:27:45.640 I need a practice more that's exact
03:27:48.279 that's the same thing with trading
03:27:50.000 trading is seen so horribly by the
03:27:52.840 masses I'm sure a lot of you guys think
03:27:55.080 day trading is the easiest [ __ ] in the
03:27:56.680 world it's not day trading is by far
03:27:59.600 like it's literally the opposite of a
03:28:01.760 get-rich quick scheme the reason why
03:28:03.880 there's no such thing as getting rich
03:28:05.199 quick okay every most people that get
03:28:07.880 into day trading they just want to get
03:28:09.560 rich quick I'm telling you right now
03:28:11.600 that's not how this [ __ ] works but I am
03:28:13.600 telling you that you can get rich from
03:28:15.840 trade trading I'm telling you without a
03:28:17.720 [ __ ] doubt in my mind that you can
03:28:19.000 get riched from Trading why because I
03:28:20.439 was able to do that [ __ ] too so I
03:28:22.080 believe in every single one of you guys
03:28:23.399 and I know I can see literally a 100
03:28:25.520 times more potential in you guys than
03:28:27.319 you can see in yourselves and I know for
03:28:29.199 a fact that you guys can get this but I
03:28:32.080 need you guys to understand that if you
03:28:34.399 guys just take this strategy and go and
03:28:36.080 apply it tomorrow and then give up
03:28:37.520 because it didn't work it's not because
03:28:39.199 the strategy doesn't work it's because
03:28:41.279 you didn't work hard enough and you guys
03:28:43.279 haven't put in enough work yet for this
03:28:45.239 to work you guys have to get into the
03:28:47.600 markets every single day you guys have
03:28:49.120 to back test every single day you guys
03:28:50.920 have to journal your trades you guys
03:28:52.680 have to get your psychology right you
03:28:54.199 guys have to get your risk management
03:28:55.600 right there's so many other things
03:28:57.160 outside of this than just the strategy
03:28:59.680 so yes am I going to lay this out for
03:29:01.520 you guys and give you guys the strategy
03:29:03.239 that I use to take trades 100% I am
03:29:05.560 because that because I want you guys to
03:29:07.000 succeed in this but no one understand
03:29:09.680 that day trading is far more than just
03:29:12.319 this one strategy and this is going to
03:29:14.120 take you to the moon and the stars
03:29:15.640 because I promise you guys you guys are
03:29:17.720 probably marking out confluences wrong
03:29:20.120 just like when I hit a crossover am I
03:29:22.000 going to hit my first crossover as good
03:29:23.600 as Big Daddy braa no but after I hit my
03:29:26.960 H 100th crossover is my 100th crossover
03:29:29.160 going to be better than my first one is
03:29:31.239 my H 100th trade going to be better than
03:29:32.880 my first one yes it is what happens when
03:29:35.120 I hit my thousandth trade is it going to
03:29:37.439 be better than my first one yes is it
03:29:39.479 going to be way better than my 100th
03:29:40.880 trade yes and the more trades that we
03:29:43.560 take the more losses that we take the
03:29:46.160 more lessons that we learn from the
03:29:47.720 market itself the better that we're
03:29:50.199 going to get at trading so it's one
03:29:52.040 thing for you guys to watch this video
03:29:54.120 but the second thing that I can't help
03:29:56.120 you guys do is put in the work
03:29:57.640 yourselves and that's the hardest thing
03:30:00.000 about getting rich the easiest thing
03:30:02.239 ever is to put in your head that you're
03:30:04.040 going to [ __ ] do it the easiest thing
03:30:06.040 about getting rich is telling yourself
03:30:08.199 I'm going to do it and I'm going to get
03:30:10.120 the Supercar and I'm going to and I'm
03:30:12.199 going to have a billion dollars I'm
03:30:13.600 going to be a millionaire but the
03:30:15.439 hardest part about getting rich is
03:30:17.160 actually doing what you say you're going
03:30:18.600 to do the hardest part about getting
03:30:20.399 rich is waking up in the morning when
03:30:21.880 you don't want to and actually putting
03:30:23.680 in the [ __ ] work the hardest part
03:30:25.279 about getting rich is doing the work
03:30:27.239 when you don't want to and you know
03:30:28.840 everybody else is quitting and it's
03:30:31.199 super easy for you to quit at that point
03:30:33.080 in time but then guess what you're going
03:30:35.120 to be just like everybody else who quit
03:30:37.160 and didn't make it so the choice is
03:30:39.439 yours whether you guys want to make this
03:30:41.319 [ __ ] or not there's a reason why only 3%
03:30:43.760 of day Traders succeed matter of fact
03:30:45.760 it's probably even lower that there's a
03:30:47.160 reason why only 1% of day Traders
03:30:48.920 succeed because that 1% of people
03:30:51.880 they're different than 99% of the other
03:30:53.720 people they're willing to do what 99% of
03:30:56.080 people aren't willing to do which is put
03:30:57.960 in the [ __ ] work and the same thing
03:30:59.720 applies to literally anything else in
03:31:01.359 business so whether you're watching this
03:31:03.840 just cuz you're thinking about getting
03:31:05.199 into trading or you're watching this
03:31:06.920 just cuz you like my videos I don't give
03:31:08.880 a [ __ ] whatever it is you're watching my
03:31:11.000 videos cuz you want to succeed in life
03:31:12.800 and you know that I'm young I'm 22 years
03:31:14.680 old and I'm a [ __ ] multi millionaire
03:31:16.439 and I made this life out from the
03:31:18.199 [ __ ] ground up by myself on my
03:31:20.080 [ __ ] own and if you guys want to be
03:31:22.720 like me I can promise you you guys can
03:31:25.319 and I can promise you that some of you
03:31:26.760 guys can be even [ __ ] greater than me
03:31:29.239 but I can also promise you this if you
03:31:31.319 don't put in the work that's required to
03:31:33.040 get to these levels you will never make
03:31:34.960 it ever in your entire life and there
03:31:37.760 are going to be points in your life
03:31:39.520 where you're [ __ ] hitting a brick
03:31:41.199 wall and you're like man I can't get
03:31:42.920 through this [ __ ] but you got to just
03:31:44.840 put your head down and keep running into
03:31:46.479 that [ __ ] wall day after day until it
03:31:48.439 breaks down and then boom you're on to
03:31:50.120 the next level and you grow and you
03:31:52.279 learn from those mistakes that you made
03:31:54.239 and then guess what I still run into
03:31:56.199 roadblocks in my own life and you're
03:31:57.800 probably thinking damn this dude's got
03:31:59.080 his life set he's got a bris he's got a
03:32:00.960 [ __ ] Rolls-Royce he's got a crib in
03:32:03.199 Puerto Rico he's living all on his own
03:32:04.720 he's got life figured out [ __ ] no I
03:32:06.359 don't I don't have life figured out for
03:32:08.120 [ __ ] there's new problems at every
03:32:10.080 single level you guys are at an early
03:32:12.160 level right now your problems are
03:32:13.800 [ __ ] easy compared to my problems
03:32:15.439 more money more problems that shit's as
03:32:16.960 real as it gets but I would much rather
03:32:18.800 deal with the problems that I'm dealing
03:32:20.279 with now than have to be dealing with
03:32:22.120 [ __ ] ass problems like paying rent
03:32:23.880 on time like like just putting [ __ ]
03:32:26.040 food on the table bro there was times
03:32:27.840 when I was door dashing where I was
03:32:29.160 literally stealing [ __ ] orders just
03:32:30.800 to eat bro there there was literally
03:32:33.439 times when I was door dashing [ __ ]
03:32:35.279 orders and I would go I would walk up to
03:32:38.080 the door and I would wait for them to
03:32:39.520 answer it so I could get cash from them
03:32:42.359 to put gas in my car so I could keep
03:32:44.680 door dashing that's the type of [ __ ]
03:32:46.640 that I was on and I know for a fact
03:32:48.479 there's some of you guys that are
03:32:49.640 watching this that are probably in worse
03:32:51.239 situations that I was in I can promise
03:32:53.800 you there's a way out of that situation
03:32:55.760 it's not just from watching one single
03:32:57.319 video it's from putting in hours and
03:32:58.960 hours and hours of work and that's the
03:33:00.760 only only way that you guys are going to
03:33:02.520 make it but would you rather put in
03:33:04.239 hours and hours and hours and hours of
03:33:05.760 work into something that is infinitely
03:33:07.319 scalable or would you rather just go
03:33:09.399 through the same dayto day that you guys
03:33:10.840 have been living for the for your entire
03:33:12.760 life just over and over and over again
03:33:14.319 groundhog [ __ ] day you got wake up
03:33:16.720 damn same shift same boss same [ __ ]
03:33:20.600 or would you rather wake up and have to
03:33:22.920 deal with problems that are exciting I
03:33:25.399 got to deal with a whole bunch of
03:33:26.600 [ __ ] every single day but I know
03:33:28.760 that I I know now at the level that I'm
03:33:31.199 at these problems these things that I'm
03:33:33.760 dealing with it's fun I'm I'm ready for
03:33:36.600 the challenges that my life brings me
03:33:38.600 why because I know when I knock these
03:33:39.880 challenges down I'm going to keep going
03:33:41.720 I'm going to keep getting better I'm
03:33:42.880 going to keep growing right now you guys
03:33:44.720 see see problems as a bad thing you guys
03:33:46.840 see challenges as a bad thing I see them
03:33:48.960 as growth opportunities and you guys
03:33:50.840 need to see them too as growth
03:33:52.880 opportunities and I just wanted to get
03:33:54.840 that through your guys' head before I go
03:33:56.840 into this strategy and I'm going to go
03:33:59.359 deeper into psychology and how you guys
03:34:01.120 can actually get this life that you guys
03:34:03.080 want and [ __ ] dream of but man
03:34:06.680 doesn't come with a lot of [ __ ] hard
03:34:08.319 work and sacrifice there there's no
03:34:10.920 avoiding it so I'm telling you right now
03:34:13.239 for everybody that's that's watching
03:34:15.160 this and just thinks that they're going
03:34:16.479 to take this strategy and just go
03:34:18.760 laughing to the bank and telling all
03:34:20.439 their friends about it like yeah that is
03:34:23.479 going to be the case after you fall on
03:34:25.239 your face hundreds of times after
03:34:27.600 attempting this over and over and over
03:34:29.040 and over again this is the strategy that
03:34:31.319 I use on a daily basis that I make a
03:34:32.960 [ __ ] ton of money with but I can promise
03:34:34.840 you your first trade you're probably
03:34:36.199 going to lose your second trade it's
03:34:37.560 going to suck as well cuz you guys just
03:34:39.439 don't understand this [ __ ] well enough
03:34:41.319 as time goes on and as you guys rewatch
03:34:43.760 this video as you guys get get more in
03:34:46.840 touch with the market get more into your
03:34:48.239 flow state with the market you guys
03:34:49.880 eventually will get this [ __ ] and all
03:34:51.760 that hard work will pay off so with that
03:34:54.239 being said let's get into our strategy
03:34:56.560 there are three things that we are going
03:34:58.640 to be looking for the first thing is our
03:35:00.479 key levels what are our key levels draws
03:35:03.160 on liquidity and imbalances the market
03:35:06.080 moves off of draws on liquidity and
03:35:08.000 imbalances so why are those our key
03:35:10.840 levels because that's what the market
03:35:11.920 moves off of what are draws on liquidity
03:35:14.239 highs and lows within the market what
03:35:16.080 are imbalances fair value gaps where do
03:35:18.600 we look for these on the 1H hour time
03:35:20.520 frame and the 4H hour time frame we are
03:35:23.439 also looking for the session highs and
03:35:26.960 lows so I'm going to show you guys how
03:35:29.120 to Mark out the session opens okay and
03:35:31.920 how to find the highs and lows of each
03:35:33.359 session because these session highs and
03:35:34.840 lows are super strong draws on liquidity
03:35:36.880 and very high Confluence for us the
03:35:38.800 second thing that we need to know are
03:35:40.439 when can we trade okay there are like I
03:35:43.359 said there are three sessions I would
03:35:45.160 prefer if if you guys don't trade Asian
03:35:46.800 session if you guys are trading New York
03:35:48.880 session so this is for indexes I'll go
03:35:51.800 ahead and add Forex here so for indexes
03:35:56.160 I'm only looking to trade from 950 to
03:35:58.279 1030 I know you're probably thinking
03:35:59.880 damn that's not much time to trade I
03:36:02.239 know we're going to be on the market
03:36:05.319 before that ideally 30 minutes before
03:36:07.680 Market opens so we can see and react to
03:36:10.040 price and whatever we're not just
03:36:12.040 getting on the onto the charts 20
03:36:13.640 minutes into Market open no we're
03:36:15.600 getting onto the charts 30 minutes
03:36:17.399 before Market opens maybe even an hour
03:36:19.239 before Market opens ideally it's an hour
03:36:20.840 before Market opens if you guys are just
03:36:22.160 getting into this but we're looking to
03:36:23.920 take our trade from between 950 and
03:36:26.479 10:30 and then for
03:36:28.279 Forex the Forex so New York Stock
03:36:31.080 Exchange opens at 9:30 a.m. eastern time
03:36:34.199 pre-market for New York Stock Exchange
03:36:35.920 opens at 8:30 a.m. eastern time that's
03:36:38.080 for indexes and like stocks and stuff
03:36:40.319 and again I trade indexes which is the
03:36:42.359 S&P 500 and NASDAQ but for people who
03:36:44.880 are trading for Forex so let's say you
03:36:46.880 want to trade like GBP USD or Euro USD
03:36:50.399 during New York session because that's
03:36:51.840 what works for you guys 8 a.m. eastern
03:36:55.239 time
03:36:57.160 210 a.m. eastern time are going to be
03:37:00.279 your guys' times to trade okay that's
03:37:03.399 Forex and then London session London
03:37:06.439 session opens at 300 a.m. all of all of
03:37:09.040 this is done in Eastern time and I'm
03:37:11.160 going to keep it as eastern time because
03:37:13.640 I operate based I'm I'm not not even on
03:37:16.120 Eastern Time right now I'm in Puerto
03:37:17.680 Rico we're an hour ahead of Eastern time
03:37:19.800 but I fully like my entire brain and my
03:37:22.680 entire schedule operates off of eastern
03:37:24.760 time because that's how the markets
03:37:26.560 operate so London session opens at 3:00
03:37:29.359 a.m. eastern time and ideally you guys
03:37:32.760 find your trade between 3:00 a.m. to
03:37:34.880 4:00 a.m. I highly recommend you guys
03:37:37.040 don't take any trades after 4:00 a.m. on
03:37:39.520 London session same thing here on New
03:37:41.399 York session if you guys can't find a
03:37:43.120 trade after 10:30 me personally I would
03:37:45.920 avoid trading for for that entire day
03:37:48.120 Forex same thing if you guys can't find
03:37:49.800 a trade from 8: to 10: a.m. I would
03:37:52.279 avoid trading for that entire day
03:37:55.359 now finally we got to what you guys came
03:37:58.000 here for how to place the [ __ ]
03:38:00.199 trade the first thing that we are
03:38:02.199 looking for is our key levels we are
03:38:04.760 going to Mark these out on the chart the
03:38:06.600 first thing that we're waiting to do
03:38:07.960 waiting for is for price to hit a key
03:38:09.960 level when price hits a key level
03:38:12.960 whether it's a 1hour high 4our high 1
03:38:15.920 hour low 4H hour low a London sessions
03:38:19.479 High London sessions low Asian sessions
03:38:22.239 High Asian sessions low previous day
03:38:24.600 high previous day low whatever it may be
03:38:28.920 maybe a 1hour fair value Gap maybe a 4H
03:38:31.160 hour fair value Gap whatever it may be
03:38:33.199 we are waiting for price to hit these
03:38:34.840 key levels then following that we are
03:38:37.319 going to scale down to the five minute
03:38:39.960 time frame and we are going to wait for
03:38:41.720 a confirmation Confluence so and I'm I'm
03:38:45.439 going to show you guys this on the chart
03:38:47.479 but we're going to scale down to the
03:38:48.680 5minute time frame we wait for our
03:38:50.520 confirmation Confluence whether that be
03:38:53.120 a 5 minute break of
03:38:55.040 structure a 5 minute inverse fair value
03:38:57.800 Gap or a 5 minute smt Divergence once
03:39:01.239 that happens are we entering no because
03:39:04.040 that just means okay the trend has
03:39:06.399 shifted but we want to know for
03:39:08.880 sure and let me draw this out for you
03:39:11.160 guys so let's say we have our key level
03:39:12.800 here and let's just say we want to take
03:39:14.520 a short trade and we push into our key
03:39:17.399 level to the upside boom and then we get
03:39:20.760 a 5 minute break of structure so this is
03:39:22.520 where we're at right now we're on the 5
03:39:24.760 minute the 5 minute's in an uptrend up
03:39:26.920 to that key level obviously right
03:39:28.960 because it needs to move up to get to
03:39:30.640 that key level and then we get a 5
03:39:32.239 minute break of structure after that
03:39:35.040 what's next in our process we're looking
03:39:37.199 for either a 5 minute fair value Gap 5
03:39:40.319 minute order block 5 minute breaker
03:39:42.880 block or 5 minute equilibrium for price
03:39:45.720 to retrace
03:39:47.479 into once price goes into one of those
03:39:51.520 confluences we're going down to the one
03:39:54.000 minute time frame so that's literally
03:39:56.319 just right when price goes into fair
03:39:59.000 value Gap order Block Breaker block
03:40:00.720 whatever it may be we're going down into
03:40:03.000 the 1 minute now when we make that 5
03:40:05.760 minute retrace up at least in this case
03:40:09.920 up typically there's going to be a one
03:40:12.560 minute uptrend formed going leading
03:40:18.120 into this
03:40:20.239 Confluence because 5 minute retrace up
03:40:23.800 even if the 5 minute time frame is in a
03:40:25.960 downtrend the one minute can be in an
03:40:27.800 uptrend pushing giving us that retrace
03:40:30.479 into that Confluence because we're in an
03:40:33.000 uptrend on the one minute in order to
03:40:34.800 wait for
03:40:36.080 confirmation because we're in this
03:40:38.080 Confluence that we're going to go down
03:40:40.120 what do we wait for we wait for a trend
03:40:42.439 shift on the one minute so whether that
03:40:45.040 be an inverse fair value Gap or a break
03:40:47.160 of structure on the one minute we wait
03:40:49.600 for that to happen and then we
03:40:52.040 enter our stop loss is placed above or
03:40:56.560 below again depending on if you're
03:40:58.160 buying or selling where the trade idea
03:41:00.920 is invalidated or wrong so let's say I
03:41:04.600 take this trade off of a this fair value
03:41:07.520 Gap where am I going to want to put my
03:41:09.560 stop- loss above the fair value Gap
03:41:12.000 because that's what my trade idea is
03:41:13.439 based off of it's based off of that this
03:41:15.439 value Gap is providing a continuation
03:41:18.800 Confluence for price to keep going down
03:41:21.760 and if price pushes past that fair value
03:41:23.600 Gap then my trade idea was wrong where
03:41:25.960 are we looking to take profit well just
03:41:28.319 like how we marked out key levels to the
03:41:31.239 upside up here we're also going to have
03:41:34.479 key levels to the downside we want to
03:41:36.439 Mark out every single key level so there
03:41:38.080 might be a 1 hour fair value gap down
03:41:40.560 here there might be a 4H hour low down
03:41:43.479 here
03:41:47.920 there might be London session low right
03:41:50.680 here those are going to be our take
03:41:52.840 profits we are going to look for
03:41:55.680 price to go down into those other key
03:41:58.920 levels and why are we looking to take
03:42:01.000 profit at those key levels because they
03:42:03.720 have a high
03:42:05.159 probability for price to reverse back up
03:42:09.600 or at least in this trade's case this
03:42:11.359 trade we were taking a short
03:42:13.479 trade okay so I know all that sounds
03:42:15.880 crazy I know that sounds a bit confusing
03:42:18.520 but we're going to go ahead and try and
03:42:20.080 apply this
03:42:21.560 now I highly recommend you guys write
03:42:24.000 this down in your notes and drill
03:42:26.399 through this as many times as possible
03:42:28.080 on the chart okay let's uh let's go
03:42:31.000 ahead and show the example from
03:42:33.720 yesterday okay so let's go back to our
03:42:37.720 list key levels where do we mark them
03:42:39.960 out 1 Hour 4 Hour okay we're looking for
03:42:42.720 highs and lows on the 1 hour and the 4
03:42:44.239 Hour and fair value value gaps on the 1
03:42:46.120 hour and 4 Hour on top of that we are
03:42:48.359 also looking for session highs and
03:42:49.800 session lows now if you guys forgot from
03:42:52.359 the beginning of this video when do the
03:42:54.640 session start that's something that I
03:42:56.920 want to mention here well London session
03:43:00.159 starts at 3:00 a.m. eastern time and
03:43:02.960 Asian session starts at
03:43:06.120 1800 eastern time so let's go ahead and
03:43:10.399 Mark Mark out our session levels first
03:43:12.840 for this
03:43:14.120 day we have Asian session
03:43:16.800 highs we have Asian session
03:43:20.120 lows London session
03:43:23.120 highs London session
03:43:28.399 lows okay this is Asian session where's
03:43:32.960 the highest point that Asian session got
03:43:34.640 to right here where's the lowest point
03:43:37.040 that Asian session got to right
03:43:39.199 here this is London session where is the
03:43:42.199 highest point that London session got to
03:43:44.560 right here where's the lowest point that
03:43:46.520 London session got to right here now if
03:43:49.560 we can see that Asian session's low has
03:43:53.080 already been pushed past we no longer
03:43:55.479 care about it because that's no longer
03:43:57.680 valid as a draw on liquidity remember
03:44:00.120 we're marking these out as draws on
03:44:02.000 liquidity so now that we've marked out
03:44:03.800 our session highs and session lows let's
03:44:05.680 go ahead and Mark out our 4our highs and
03:44:07.760 4our lows so we actually don't really
03:44:10.600 have we actually don't have any 4-Hour
03:44:13.040 highs and 4-Hour lows for us to Mark out
03:44:16.080 besides this one right here that was
03:44:18.120 already marked out which it was Asian
03:44:19.760 sessions High we do have a 4-Hour fair
03:44:22.359 value Gap right here but this was
03:44:24.880 already filled
03:44:26.640 in okay and had already been reacted off
03:44:29.319 of so we no longer care about that we
03:44:32.040 have this 4H hour low right here but
03:44:34.000 it's already been pushed past so we
03:44:35.600 don't care about it so there's really no
03:44:38.239 fair value gaps and no lows or highs on
03:44:41.680 the 4 Hour that I really want to care
03:44:44.000 about you're probably saying what what
03:44:45.120 about this High well price isn't going
03:44:47.319 to move all the way up there and take
03:44:48.560 out this High we just have to know and
03:44:51.159 understand if this is where price is
03:44:52.560 opening it's not going to move all the
03:44:54.840 way up here and move 2.7% in a day and
03:44:58.120 those are small things that you guys
03:44:59.239 will pick up as time goes on okay now
03:45:02.120 let's mark out our 1eh hour confluences
03:45:05.920 well we have a 1 hour high right here we
03:45:08.479 have a 1 hour low right here but it gets
03:45:10.960 taken out before Market even opens at
03:45:13.319 9:30 so I'm going to go ahead and delete
03:45:15.680 that we have this 1 hour low right here
03:45:18.040 move down then a move up and this is
03:45:19.760 actually Asian or sorry this is actually
03:45:21.359 London sessions low so we don't have to
03:45:23.800 mark that out because it's already been
03:45:25.199 marked and really the only thing that we
03:45:27.520 have left here is this 1 hour fair value
03:45:29.840 Gap so that's how I Mark out my key
03:45:32.239 levels we marked out every single one of
03:45:34.760 our key levels for the day awesome so we
03:45:36.960 have one these Asian session highs these
03:45:39.760 London session highs this 1 hour high
03:45:42.960 this 1 hour fair value Gap and the
03:45:45.159 London session
03:45:46.760 lows pretty solid so now that we marked
03:45:50.279 out our key levels what's next we're
03:45:53.080 looking for our times to trade so I'm
03:45:54.880 looking to trade from 950 to 10:30
03:45:57.040 that's when I'm willing to be able to
03:45:58.120 place my trades okay so cool let's go
03:46:01.439 ahead and Mark that out on the
03:46:05.920 chart
03:46:07.840 950 to 10:30 boom
03:46:11.359 cool now I know all of this is super
03:46:13.800 overwhelming but trust trust me we're
03:46:16.159 almost there we've marked out our key
03:46:17.840 levels we marked out the times that
03:46:19.239 we're willing to trade and most of the
03:46:20.880 time I don't even have these lines on
03:46:22.279 the chart I only have the session lines
03:46:23.800 on the chart but just here I'll get rid
03:46:26.080 of the 10:30 line cuz we don't really
03:46:27.520 need that but this is typically when I'm
03:46:29.760 looking to take trades okay now that we
03:46:32.680 have all this marked out let's go
03:46:34.399 through our step by step the first thing
03:46:36.680 that we need to wait for price to do is
03:46:38.880 to go into a key
03:46:40.199 level okay so Market opens on this
03:46:43.319 Candlestick right here right we push
03:46:46.080 down and we actually take out these
03:46:47.439 London session lows so cool key level
03:46:49.199 got hit but then we don't see a break of
03:46:51.840 structure on the 5 minute we don't see
03:46:53.760 an inverse for Value gap on the 5 minute
03:46:55.960 we don't see anything we actually push
03:46:58.199 back we push into this 1 hour key level
03:47:01.960 and then this was the example of the smt
03:47:03.680 that I showed you so off of this no smt
03:47:06.880 Divergence no break of structure no
03:47:09.159 inverse for Value gap on the 5- minute
03:47:10.840 time frame we don't break structure to
03:47:12.520 the upside we don't get an inverse for
03:47:14.279 Value Gap and we don't get an smt
03:47:15.800 Divergence however what we do get is
03:47:19.760 this 1hour fair value Gap that gets
03:47:21.880 filled and then what did we have in smt
03:47:24.399 Divergence so we entered into a key
03:47:26.000 level we got our confirmation
03:47:29.960 Confluence our confirmation Confluence
03:47:32.359 was this smt
03:47:34.760 Divergence we're looking to take the
03:47:36.640 trade on
03:47:38.680 NASDAQ so now what are we looking for
03:47:42.560 well we're looking for either
03:47:45.120 equilibrium to get hit we are looking
03:47:47.439 for fair value Gap looking for order
03:47:50.199 block looking for breaker block okay now
03:47:54.159 this one is actually kind of a a weird
03:47:57.800 situation here so where is the order
03:48:00.000 block and where is the breaker block
03:48:01.760 well we break structure to the downside
03:48:03.960 right here and we actually maintain the
03:48:07.120 bearish structure right prior to this we
03:48:09.159 were in an uptrend we break structure
03:48:11.279 right here we don't break structure back
03:48:13.359 to the upside so we're still in bearish
03:48:15.520 structure here so this move
03:48:19.760 up is
03:48:22.359 technically a fill of equilibrium in a
03:48:26.439 sense okay I know that sounds like
03:48:29.080 really ridiculous and whatever but this
03:48:31.920 move up is a Confluence getting hit not
03:48:35.720 only in the smt
03:48:38.239 Divergence but because we had were we
03:48:40.680 were still in this downtrend cuz most of
03:48:43.720 the time when we get an
03:48:45.800 Divergence were or at least a bearish
03:48:48.640 smt Divergence we in an uptrend right
03:48:51.600 but in this case we were already in a
03:48:53.359 downtrend so this move up was not only
03:48:57.520 our confirmation Confluence but also our
03:49:00.600 continuation
03:49:03.159 Confluence so following that I'm like
03:49:06.319 okay cool again remember the only time
03:49:09.520 that I'm willing to trade is at
03:49:11.640 950 so we make this move up make that
03:49:14.279 smt Divergence and hit equilibrium and
03:49:17.560 actually go far past equilibrium and we
03:49:19.520 also go into this order block and so
03:49:22.359 this right here is the order block on
03:49:23.640 the 5 minute and this right here is the
03:49:26.279 breaker block come on on the 5 minute
03:49:30.080 this move down is the breaker and this
03:49:32.560 move up is the order block we push into
03:49:35.040 both of those and we actually go above
03:49:36.880 both of those and that was like the
03:49:38.239 example on the order block part where I
03:49:40.920 was saying like if we do go above the
03:49:42.920 order Block it's not touching into the
03:49:44.279 order block It's actually an smt that's
03:49:46.159 exactly what this is and then we get a
03:49:48.239 one minute break of structure right here
03:49:49.960 so you're probably saying well this is
03:49:52.760 when you enter right no could we have
03:49:56.199 entered right here sure on this
03:49:58.199 Candlestick closure underneath here not
03:50:00.120 only do we get a one minute break of
03:50:01.560 structure to the downside on this candle
03:50:03.159 closure but we also get a inverse fair
03:50:06.720 value Gap right here but it's not 950
03:50:09.399 yet so I just have to sit on my hands
03:50:11.199 and wait when 950 finally hits we're
03:50:14.279 actually back in an uptrend on the 1
03:50:16.359 minute and I'm not willing to take that
03:50:18.159 trade just yet until we get what a break
03:50:21.399 of structure back down to the downside
03:50:23.199 on the 1 minute or an inverse for Value
03:50:26.560 Gap to the downside on the 1 minute we
03:50:28.520 get that actually right at 1 15 or at
03:50:30.800 950 we get an inverse fair value Gap
03:50:33.399 right here right when this candle closes
03:50:35.439 boom 950 opens that is when I'm going to
03:50:38.120 want to be taking my short
03:50:41.120 position
03:50:43.120 okay my stop loss I can either put it
03:50:46.479 right above this inverse for Value Gap I
03:50:48.319 can put it above these highs wherever
03:50:50.560 your trade idea gets invalidated so this
03:50:52.880 trade I'm taking it off of this inverse
03:50:54.960 for Value Gap maybe I just put it right
03:50:56.880 above the inverse for Value Gap and then
03:50:58.800 targeting well we look at our key levels
03:51:01.720 we have this right here boom that's a 1
03:51:03.479 to 1.7 risk reward ratio so if you go in
03:51:07.000 with go in with $100 you're making 170
03:51:10.680 bucks or 171
03:51:12.680 bucks on this trade
03:51:15.560 or if you go in with $1,000 or risk
03:51:19.960 $1,000 you're making 1,700 in 10 bucks
03:51:24.439 okay now is this the one and only
03:51:27.680 takeprofit that we need so when I showed
03:51:30.199 you guys on trade Locker how there's
03:51:32.319 multiple partial closes that how you can
03:51:34.520 take profits at certain points it's the
03:51:36.840 same thing with this is this a good
03:51:38.800 trade yes for sure but could we
03:51:41.359 potentially see price go even lower yeah
03:51:44.840 for sure so that's when we can go and
03:51:48.239 look to the left a bit because we don't
03:51:50.760 have anything in recent price data that
03:51:53.720 we can use for take profits so this is
03:51:55.520 when we can go over here and look and we
03:51:58.800 can see okay well this is a 4H hour low
03:52:02.920 this is a draw on liquidity on the high
03:52:04.600 time frame so it's a key level this is a
03:52:07.359 4our low so this is a draw in liquidity
03:52:11.760 on the high time frame this is a key
03:52:13.279 level this is a 4our Lev low this is a
03:52:15.640 draw liquidity a key level on the high
03:52:18.319 time frame all of those are able to be
03:52:21.560 take profits and look at that price goes
03:52:25.359 and hits every single one of them and
03:52:27.880 respects it to a t oh look how cool this
03:52:32.000 is respects it to a T and then following
03:52:35.159 that what does price do an inverse fair
03:52:38.359 value Gap off of a key level on the 5
03:52:41.439 minute followed by a retracement Down
03:52:44.600 into what is this an order block
03:52:46.880 followed by a move up you enter off that
03:52:49.600 stops underneath these lows what happens
03:52:51.600 boom price moves up right after that
03:52:53.760 this [ __ ]
03:52:55.439 is it's so beautiful man thank God for
03:52:59.479 trading thank God for trading it's so
03:53:02.800 beautiful okay I know that was super
03:53:05.479 overwhelming and a lot of information so
03:53:09.600 again let's just go through this slowly
03:53:12.439 but surely we marked out our key Lev LS
03:53:15.159 our key levels are 1our highs 4our highs
03:53:19.159 1H hour fair value gaps 4H hour fair
03:53:21.640 value gaps and session highs and session
03:53:24.080 lows session highs and session lows are
03:53:26.520 important draws on liquidity because
03:53:28.520 when every when a new session starts
03:53:30.920 there are new Traders and new smart
03:53:33.000 money new market makers new algorithms
03:53:34.960 that are being applied to the market so
03:53:36.840 when these New Market Movers come into
03:53:39.199 the market previous algorith algorithms
03:53:42.399 that were on the market they stop okay
03:53:44.920 new money comes into the market and says
03:53:47.199 I want price to do this so what are they
03:53:49.239 going to do they are going to manipulate
03:53:51.680 the previous session take out all the
03:53:54.479 previous Traders from the past session
03:53:56.960 and then make price going the way that
03:53:58.359 it wants to go we can visually see this
03:54:01.159 on this day
03:54:02.560 perfectly these London session lows we
03:54:05.800 see price boom immediately we take out
03:54:08.760 these London session lows goodbye London
03:54:11.359 session Traders but on top of that we
03:54:13.479 have these London session highs in these
03:54:15.399 Asian session highs what does price do
03:54:17.359 right after it takes out those London
03:54:18.600 session lows boom Another leg of
03:54:20.880 manipulation we take out London session
03:54:22.479 Traders and we take out Asian session
03:54:24.600 Traders something that I want to show
03:54:26.560 you guys specifically for my Forex
03:54:28.960 people and how this applies to you guys
03:54:31.920 look here it's the same thing with
03:54:33.239 London session and Asian session we have
03:54:36.120 Asian session highs Asian session lows
03:54:39.040 look right when London session opens we
03:54:41.840 immediately manipulate the Asian session
03:54:44.080 low
03:54:45.359 and then get legs
03:54:46.680 up I'm telling you bro this Market
03:54:50.760 it there is a rhyme and a reason to why
03:54:53.840 and how it moves and you guys are slowly
03:54:56.880 but surely going to get the hang of this
03:54:59.640 okay let's do another example okay so
03:55:02.120 for this next example it is literally
03:55:04.520 the following day um so we just came
03:55:08.279 from Tuesday's price action we are now
03:55:10.439 going to Monday's price action so this
03:55:13.560 is Monday's price action on March 3rd
03:55:16.880 2025 what are we going to do Mark out
03:55:20.040 our key levels we'll start with the
03:55:21.840 session highs
03:55:23.479 so do this on the hourly it'll be a
03:55:25.960 little bit
03:55:28.880 easier bless me London session
03:55:32.439 highs London session
03:55:35.199 lows Asian session highs Asian session
03:55:39.479 lows okay now sorry I kind of sped
03:55:42.920 through that but again this this is
03:55:44.479 London session boom from 3: to 9:30 or
03:55:48.239 actually it's 3: to
03:55:50.120 8:30 again because New York premarket
03:55:52.760 opens at 8:30 so again if like let's say
03:55:56.399 830 the
03:55:58.080 8:30 high is was higher than this that
03:56:02.560 wouldn't count um we would look for the
03:56:04.760 high that's prior to 8:30 so technically
03:56:07.479 we're looking for London session highs
03:56:09.199 and lows before this point it's only
03:56:12.560 when we're trading indexes and for Forex
03:56:14.880 your Market open is going to be at 8 so
03:56:17.279 I know that's that's really confusing I
03:56:19.159 know we literally have like three
03:56:20.319 different Market opens but when we're
03:56:22.439 marking out London session highs and
03:56:25.080 lows for New York Stock Exchange on
03:56:27.560 indexes we are looking for them before
03:56:30.239 8:30 okay and then when we're looking
03:56:33.000 for London session highs and lows for
03:56:35.399 4ex we are looking for them before 8
03:56:38.800 okay so we have London session High
03:56:42.319 Asian session High we can go ahead and
03:56:44.239 disregard Asian session High why because
03:56:46.000 London session has already pushed above
03:56:47.479 it so the key level has already been
03:56:49.439 pushed through and there is no reaction
03:56:50.760 off of it then we have London session
03:56:53.199 low and Asian session low okay let's
03:56:56.600 look at our 4our we have this bearish
03:57:00.560 for Value Gap but it already got
03:57:02.439 disrespected so we'll go ahead and get
03:57:04.120 rid of
03:57:04.920 that we have this 4our High which was
03:57:07.960 the Asian Asian session high but we
03:57:10.479 already pushed above that so we can go
03:57:12.279 ahead and disregard that we have this 4H
03:57:14.800 hour High which is you know a little bit
03:57:17.560 close to London session high so we might
03:57:19.000 as well Mark it we also have this 4-Hour
03:57:20.680 fair value Gap all the way up here but
03:57:22.800 eh I don't really see much use in
03:57:25.000 marking that out because it's above two
03:57:28.159 highs and if Market really wants to push
03:57:30.040 up there then we can mark it as the
03:57:32.279 market starts to push we have this 4H
03:57:34.199 hour fair value Gap right here now
03:57:36.080 that's pretty much everything on the 4
03:57:37.560 Hour let's go down to the 1 hour we have
03:57:39.720 a 1 hour low right here we have another
03:57:42.840 1 hour low right here and then we have
03:57:46.040 this is the 4H hour fair value gap which
03:57:48.399 is overlapping with this 1 hour fair
03:57:50.439 value Gap and then last but not least we
03:57:52.520 have this tiny little 1 hour fair value
03:57:54.560 Gap right
03:57:56.520 here I don't really bother with marking
03:57:59.600 out these hourly lows just because
03:58:02.960 they're so far down from where Market is
03:58:05.120 going to be opening at might as well
03:58:07.520 disregard them even though price did end
03:58:09.159 up going all the way down there I'm
03:58:10.840 going to disregard them because I know
03:58:13.399 my pre-market itself would completely
03:58:15.199 disregard these things so let's go
03:58:18.439 through our steps again when are we
03:58:20.239 looking to trade at
03:58:22.680 950 so we'll go ahead and put that on
03:58:25.199 there ah let's do the same thing for the
03:58:27.279 S&P 500 before we forget the S&P
03:58:30.960 500 London session
03:58:33.199 highs right here London session lows
03:58:37.159 right here Asian session highs right
03:58:39.600 here Asian session lows right here we
03:58:42.479 can go ahead and disregard Asian session
03:58:43.880 High because London session had already
03:58:45.439 moved past them without a reaction and
03:58:47.840 then let's go into the 4H hour to see if
03:58:49.560 we see anything we have a 4-Hour fair
03:58:51.720 value Gap right here awesome draw on
03:58:53.640 liquidity or awesome pull we have this
03:58:55.840 4-Hour high right here see that's
03:58:58.000 something that I'm willing to Mark out
03:58:59.359 we also have this 4our high up here but
03:59:01.439 there's no reason to mark it it's pretty
03:59:02.960 far from where Market is going to be
03:59:05.000 opening at and if price decides to push
03:59:06.880 all the way up there then we can go
03:59:08.199 ahead and Mark it um when the time
03:59:10.720 comes so we'll we'll do this on NASDAQ
03:59:13.680 just because this was the trade that I
03:59:15.920 took Market opens at 9:30 we push above
03:59:19.800 London session highs and what do we end
03:59:21.880 up making an smt Divergence again this
03:59:24.560 time it's a bearish smt Divergence or
03:59:26.960 the past one was a bearish smt
03:59:28.359 Divergence as well
03:59:30.199 sorry smt Divergence how do we know
03:59:32.479 there's an S&T Divergence because on the
03:59:34.080 S&P 500 when Market opens London session
03:59:37.840 highs do we push above London session
03:59:40.080 highs no we make a lower
03:59:41.760 high so what index and am I going to be
03:59:44.640 looking at for today's trading day
03:59:47.120 NASDAQ because NASDAQ is the lagging
03:59:49.239 index the S&P 500 is telling us telling
03:59:52.840 the future that hey we're going to go
03:59:56.479 down so now that we get boom key level
04:00:00.840 pushed in a or a confirmation
04:00:04.439 Confluence and not to mention we get a
04:00:07.720 5minute break of structure to the
04:00:09.120 downside right here as well so
04:00:11.199 technically two confirmation confluences
04:00:13.239 as if we needed more more what are we
04:00:15.040 looking for we're looking for fair value
04:00:17.199 gaps order blocks and breaker blocks now
04:00:19.239 on the 5
04:00:20.479 minute this blue candle right here is
04:00:22.720 our order
04:00:24.840 block these two down black candles are
04:00:27.439 our breaker
04:00:31.920 block equilibrium would literally have
04:00:34.399 to be drawn from this high all the way
04:00:36.120 down to this low
04:00:37.600 but that's not happening because we're
04:00:39.880 trying to take our trade right the freak
04:00:42.359 now what's the last
04:00:44.880 Confluence that we have fair value
04:00:48.239 Gap so we don't hit the order block we
04:00:51.600 don't hit the breaker block equilibrium
04:00:54.199 you know it's going to be all the way
04:00:55.359 down here but what do we do we end up
04:00:58.040 filling in this fair value Gap we see
04:00:59.720 price push into this fair value
04:01:02.840 Gap scale
04:01:05.080 down we break one minute structure to
04:01:07.720 the upside to fill in this five minute
04:01:10.159 Confluence so what are we waiting for
04:01:14.319 either a one minute break of structure
04:01:16.359 or a 1 minute inverse fair value Gap we
04:01:18.760 have the one minute low right here and
04:01:20.439 the fair value Gap right here that we're
04:01:22.279 waiting for it to be inverse both of
04:01:23.760 them H happen at the same time on this
04:01:25.359 Candlestick closure underneath this Gap
04:01:27.479 and underneath this
04:01:29.479 low we can go ahead and enter into a
04:01:31.680 short position we can either put our
04:01:33.359 stops Above This high or above the
04:01:35.040 inverse for Value Gap whatever you guys
04:01:37.199 see fit whatever whatever you guys want
04:01:39.920 whatever you guys took the trade off of
04:01:42.199 Target
04:01:45.120 are other key levels that we had these
04:01:47.159 are backtack days within the market
04:01:49.199 where I just went step by step showing
04:01:51.319 you guys the exact strategy that I just
04:01:53.439 laid out in front of you and how you
04:01:55.000 guys can take winning trades doing that
04:01:56.920 backtack days Monday and Tuesday and I
04:01:59.159 took both of these trades and you guys
04:02:00.600 can watch the trade Recaps on them I
04:02:03.399 took both of these trades we go down we
04:02:06.159 take out London session low we take out
04:02:08.319 this 1 hour low we take out Asian
04:02:10.199 session low and then we go down to fill
04:02:12.319 in this fair value Gap and we fill
04:02:14.120 completely
04:02:15.399 actually and then would you look at that
04:02:18.239 we take out key levels and then get a
04:02:20.159 mini reversal off of
04:02:23.560 it if you thought day trading was a lie
04:02:26.040 if you thought day trading was a scam I
04:02:27.920 hate to break it to you I just proved
04:02:29.439 you [ __ ] wrong and I'm going to keep
04:02:31.880 proving you guys wrong every single day
04:02:33.359 with my trade Recaps obviously I make
04:02:35.439 mistakes here and there I am not perfect
04:02:38.439 nobody's perfect in the market okay I
04:02:41.159 take losses all the time that's just
04:02:43.000 part of the day trading game game but
04:02:45.960 that is how you guys can execute trades
04:02:48.680 on a daily basis following that step by
04:02:51.520 step is it systematic no because it's
04:02:54.640 different confluences every day right on
04:02:58.760 Tuesday the day prior this we didn't
04:03:00.479 have a fair value Gap what did we have
04:03:02.960 we had equilibrium this day we have a
04:03:05.279 fair value Gap yes both of them were off
04:03:08.199 whatever High time frame liquidity or
04:03:10.680 sorry session liquidity sweeps with smt
04:03:12.560 Divergence but
04:03:14.319 some days there might not be an smt
04:03:15.960 Divergence there might just be a regular
04:03:18.399 liquidity sweep and then a 5-minute
04:03:20.159 break structure to the downside and then
04:03:21.520 an order block getting filled and then
04:03:23.560 it's a one minute inverse for Value Gap
04:03:25.600 entry okay that's why we have to be
04:03:27.720 fluent and that's why I ask you guys to
04:03:29.560 you know make sure we know and
04:03:30.800 understand these confluences before
04:03:32.000 getting into this because if you guys
04:03:33.680 don't don't understand these then you
04:03:35.159 guys are going to miss out on
04:03:36.120 opportunities from the market but once
04:03:37.600 you guys understand these holy smokes
04:03:39.680 you guys are going to be able to find
04:03:40.760 opportunity from the market pretty much
04:03:42.479 every single day and that that is how I
04:03:44.439 would approach day trading okay and
04:03:47.479 actually executing now like I promised
04:03:49.920 and like I told you guys that's not
04:03:52.399 everything that's just one piece of the
04:03:54.239 puzzle and I'm I'm kind of shooting
04:03:56.920 myself in the foot here because I know
04:03:59.560 I'm going to have to make this video
04:04:00.920 longer but I'm doing you guys a huge
04:04:03.439 favor by going over psychology and by
04:04:06.199 going over risk management and those are
04:04:08.080 two Super Key super super important
04:04:11.640 parts of day trading that you guys just
04:04:13.840 really really have to know in order to
04:04:15.520 be a profitable Trader it's it's
04:04:17.199 literally a non-negotiable so if you
04:04:19.439 guys think that you're set for life
04:04:21.080 because you have tjr strategy I advise
04:04:23.880 you to stick around because we need to
04:04:26.159 know about how to manage our risk within
04:04:27.880 the markets and also how to manage our
04:04:30.319 heads and I know that sounds dumb but
04:04:33.880 it's one of the it's one of the most
04:04:35.920 powerful tools and also it's going to be
04:04:38.760 one of the hardest things for you guys
04:04:39.760 to get over within your own trading is
04:04:42.640 psychology and the effect that it has on
04:04:45.680 your own trading so with that being said
04:04:47.720 let's get into how to figure out how
04:04:50.239 much we are going to be risking per
04:04:52.199 trade okay so this is going to be risk
04:04:54.399 management explained and I'm going to
04:04:56.800 try and do this the best of my abilities
04:04:59.399 understanding that every single Trader
04:05:00.680 is different every single person's win
04:05:02.640 rate is going to be different every
04:05:04.120 single person's average risk reward is
04:05:06.439 going to be different so when we're
04:05:09.680 going over this first of all what even
04:05:12.040 is risk to reward you guys saw me using
04:05:14.880 these tools when I was showing you guys
04:05:17.199 entering into trades so this is a short
04:05:19.439 trade for example so up here I kind of
04:05:22.159 use this to show where I want my trade
04:05:24.359 to go right the top of this gray box is
04:05:26.800 where my stop- loss is the bottom of
04:05:28.680 this blue box is where my takeprofit is
04:05:31.000 the middle is where I enter at so if my
04:05:35.000 stop loss is up here and my take profit
04:05:37.680 is right let's say let's put this right
04:05:41.720 perfect okay right here for example this
04:05:44.960 is a 1 to 2.02 risk reward ratio how do
04:05:49.600 I know that because this is telling me
04:05:51.800 so again we know where to put our stop
04:05:54.080 losses and we know where to put our take
04:05:56.000 profits so that's already sorted out
04:05:57.720 right we already taught you guys about
04:05:59.000 that in the chart portion we put our
04:06:00.760 stop loss above or if we're taking a buy
04:06:04.199 position below where our trade idea gets
04:06:07.239 invalidated matter of fact hold on I
04:06:09.479 need to show you guys a buy I just
04:06:11.520 realized I need to show you guys a buy
04:06:13.319 position position um example really
04:06:15.520 quick let me just Speed Run and try and
04:06:17.680 find a buy position
04:06:19.720 example okay buy position example
04:06:25.479 speedrun Market open we won't fully
04:06:28.600 speedrun this we'll do it for your guys'
04:06:31.640 sake because I love you guys no other
04:06:33.680 Mentor is willing to get on here for
04:06:35.279 [ __ ] hours on end London session
04:06:41.040 highs London session lows
04:06:45.479 so Asian
04:06:46.240 [Music]
04:06:47.840 session Asian session highs we can go
04:06:50.040 ahead and disregard these because London
04:06:51.479 session already moved past them with no
04:06:53.159 reaction Asian session
04:06:55.600 lows
04:06:57.120 okay not only
04:07:01.479 that let's look at our hourly we
04:07:05.520 have an hourly low right
04:07:09.080 here we have an hourly fair value Gap
04:07:12.080 right here but
04:07:14.239 it already got filled and got a reaction
04:07:16.159 off of it so we can go ahead and
04:07:17.279 disregard this this one however has not
04:07:20.439 been filled yet I mean it gets filled
04:07:22.640 but hasn't been filled
04:07:24.720 yet and then we have hourly highs all
04:07:27.000 the way up here but knowing that Market
04:07:28.640 opens down here is price really going to
04:07:30.560 jump all the way up here to take out
04:07:31.880 liquidity probably not so I know I
04:07:35.319 didn't go on the 4 Hour but we don't we
04:07:38.439 don't need to because the entries are
04:07:40.720 here so let's get into this
04:07:45.159 Market opens what do we do we take out
04:07:48.199 our key levels London session lows we
04:07:50.520 took take these out we take out hourly
04:07:52.439 lows and we take out these Asian session
04:07:54.600 lows what are we looking for next we
04:07:56.239 want to look at the time that we're
04:07:57.199 going to trade 950
04:08:00.040 boom okay we're looking at current
04:08:02.720 current price action we have this
04:08:06.640 potential bearish fair value
04:08:08.520 Gap this bearish fair value Gap that
04:08:11.040 could potentially get inversed
04:08:13.560 do we inverse it the first time no but
04:08:15.359 do we inverse it the second time yes we
04:08:17.040 get an inverse right here awesome now
04:08:19.720 what are we looking for 5 minute time
04:08:22.239 frame Confluence so we end up continuing
04:08:25.479 higher and you're probably freaking out
04:08:27.479 and I we're going to talk about this in
04:08:29.479 in the psychology class soon don't worry
04:08:32.720 soon but you guys are going to get fear
04:08:34.080 of missing out because we're getting so
04:08:35.720 close to our takeprofit we're getting so
04:08:37.399 close to London session high is like ah
04:08:39.000 I just want to take this trade you got
04:08:40.640 to be patient patience you got to be
04:08:43.000 super patient
04:08:44.520 we have to wait until we get a 5-minute
04:08:46.279 retrace boom 5 minute
04:08:48.000 retrace where's our order block this
04:08:50.199 move down this is the move down that
04:08:51.960 cause what the liquidity
04:08:54.640 sweep where's our breaker block boom
04:08:58.000 this is our breaker block it comes into
04:08:59.479 not only our order block our breaker
04:09:00.880 block there's no fair value
04:09:03.279 gaps but it also comes into equilibrium
04:09:06.720 awesome so it hits three confluences we
04:09:08.520 can choose from whatever the [ __ ]
04:09:09.680 Confluence we want it's giving us a
04:09:11.640 whole bunch of options
04:09:14.800 this is the retrace what are we waiting
04:09:17.159 for either a one minute break of
04:09:18.520 structure or a 1 minute inverse for
04:09:21.840 Value Gap we get
04:09:24.319 both ideally we enter on the one minute
04:09:26.720 inverse for Value Gap because that gives
04:09:28.199 us a better
04:09:30.600 entry you can go ahead and put your stop
04:09:32.760 loss either underneath these
04:09:34.600 lows or underneath these lows whatever
04:09:36.960 it may be I would probably put it just a
04:09:38.439 little bit underneath these lows cuz
04:09:40.040 this is where our tra our trade idea is
04:09:41.399 off this inverse value Gap and the
04:09:43.359 there's no reason to put your stop loss
04:09:44.720 so tight right here okay might as well
04:09:47.080 just have it underneath these lows one
04:09:48.960 to 1.78 risk reward ratio boom there's
04:09:52.359 another example for you guys Banger long
04:09:54.760 position but anyways what I was saying
04:09:57.680 let's look at this now that we have this
04:09:59.680 in front of us this is our entry this is
04:10:03.199 our stop loss our stop- loss is always
04:10:05.720 going to be a set fixed loss
04:10:09.960 amount okay our take profits are going
04:10:13.000 to be what's variable so our stop our
04:10:15.840 stop loss we're always going to be
04:10:18.000 losing the same like ideally the same
04:10:20.199 dollar amount per trade ideally our take
04:10:23.600 profits are what is variable so again if
04:10:25.600 my take profits all the way up here then
04:10:28.080 we have a one to 3.22 risk reward ratio
04:10:32.000 so what even is a risk reward ratio in
04:10:34.080 the first place it means for every one
04:10:36.800 that I risk I'm getting X in return or
04:10:42.119 whatever it says right here in return so
04:10:45.159 if I risk $11,000 and I win this trade
04:10:48.520 and it hits takeprofit then I will make
04:10:53.560 $3,220 if I risk $100 on this trade I
04:10:57.319 will make
04:11:00.199 $322 if I risk $1 on this trade I will
04:11:04.080 make
04:11:07.920 $322 if this is my takeprofit if I risk
04:11:11.279 $100 I make 100
04:11:14.040 $78 you guys get the gist of it by
04:11:17.560 now that is what risk reward is ideally
04:11:21.159 we are only taking risk to rewards that
04:11:23.560 are one to one and higher because at
04:11:27.920 that point in time if we have a lower
04:11:29.720 risk reward ratio than 1: one then the
04:11:32.760 odds are against us meaning we're
04:11:35.080 risking more than we're about to win
04:11:36.920 there's no reason to take that trade and
04:11:39.119 there's going to be times where you guys
04:11:40.800 just straight up you guys have a bad
04:11:42.960 risk reward ratio where your stop loss
04:11:45.319 where your trade idea gets invalidated
04:11:47.439 all the way down here and your
04:11:48.479 takeprofit is going to be right here is
04:11:51.279 this a one:1 risk reward ratio no so are
04:11:54.560 you going to take this trade no now that
04:11:57.080 we understand that let's talk about this
04:12:00.720 there are two types of
04:12:02.239 Traders Traders with a high risk
04:12:05.359 reward
04:12:07.119 meaning they look for trades like this a
04:12:10.239 one
04:12:11.239 to 8 65 risk reward Ratio or a 1 to 10
04:12:15.760 risk reward ratio meaning for every one
04:12:17.920 that they risk they get 10
04:12:21.920 back but those Traders have a low win
04:12:24.960 rate so in turn they they have a low win
04:12:28.680 rate meaning they probably only win 30%
04:12:32.720 of their
04:12:33.840 trades but if on those wins they're
04:12:37.359 making way more than what they're losing
04:12:39.800 per trade they're still profitable
04:12:42.080 Traders but but because they have such a
04:12:45.199 low win rate they are going to have to
04:12:48.040 use lower risk so they are going to have
04:12:50.040 to risk less of their account per trade
04:12:54.239 in order to just keep their account
04:12:55.920 alive okay because they know hey I can I
04:12:59.399 could potentially go on a losing streak
04:13:01.399 I could potentially lose 70 trades in a
04:13:03.520 row out of a 100 before I get my one win
04:13:07.319 or before I get whatever 30 wins in a
04:13:09.159 row to make it all back and be
04:13:10.920 profitable and they have to allocate for
04:13:13.119 for that so they have to use lower risk
04:13:15.119 or you can be on the other side of the
04:13:16.720 Spectrum which is the trader that I am
04:13:19.119 where I get a low risk reward so most of
04:13:22.640 the time my risk reward is anywhere from
04:13:24.800 like 1 to 1
04:13:27.720 point5 one to two one to three 1 to four
04:13:33.520 sometimes if it's a crazy trade with a
04:13:35.640 high win rate I have a high win rate I
04:13:37.640 win a lot of the trades that I take but
04:13:39.600 I have a lowrisk reward but because I
04:13:42.560 have a high win rate but a lower risk
04:13:44.840 reward and in order to get more out of
04:13:47.880 my trades I can risk a little bit more
04:13:51.319 does that mean I go crazy on the risk no
04:13:54.359 does that mean I'm risking 10% on my
04:13:56.319 account per trade absolutely not because
04:13:59.479 that means I only have 10 shots before
04:14:01.359 my account is
04:14:02.640 gone 10 10% risk trade trades means 100%
04:14:07.319 of your account is gone if you lose all
04:14:08.840 of them and there are times where you
04:14:10.640 will lose 10 trades in a row I have been
04:14:12.720 there for it sucks but you will get out
04:14:16.159 of it losing streaks happen all the time
04:14:18.760 especially like no matter what if you're
04:14:21.520 profitable Traders it's just like hot
04:14:22.920 and cold streaks sometimes they're just
04:14:24.600 hitting like crazy right now I'm hitting
04:14:26.359 like crazy I'm up 40K on the week but I
04:14:30.680 I just know for a fact eventually this
04:14:33.000 win streak it's going to be done and I'm
04:14:35.119 probably going to lose some money but
04:14:36.880 that's just trading for you you have to
04:14:38.680 know and understand we are going to lose
04:14:41.239 so by knowing and understand we are
04:14:42.640 going to lose lose we have to we have to
04:14:44.880 lower our risk a little bit so what does
04:14:47.159 lower risk versus higher risk look like
04:14:50.159 me personally I'm risking anywhere from
04:14:53.040 1 to
04:14:54.960 3% of my account per trade that's for a
04:14:59.640 higher that's for higher risk traders
04:15:02.399 that have a high win rate and a low risk
04:15:05.040 reward for the high Riser reward and the
04:15:08.080 lower win rate people you guys are
04:15:10.439 probably going to want to be risking
04:15:11.960 0.25 to 1% of your total account size
04:15:15.199 per trade so what does that mean that
04:15:17.359 means if I have a $100 account if I'm a
04:15:20.199 higher risk person I'm going to be
04:15:22.040 risking $1 to $3 per trade if I have
04:15:25.880 $100 in my account and I'm a lower risk
04:15:28.960 Trader I'm going to be risking 25 cents
04:15:31.600 to $1 per trade I know it doesn't sound
04:15:35.199 really that cool and really that amazing
04:15:37.399 right when you're only able to risk a
04:15:40.600 dollar with a100 $100 account
04:15:43.439 well that's the reality of trading it's
04:15:45.720 not a get-rich quick scheme I already
04:15:47.239 told you guys that it's it's slow and
04:15:49.720 steady slow and steady wins the race in
04:15:52.119 trading you keep stacking wins with
04:15:54.399 minimal losses and eventually you get
04:15:56.760 freaking paid and there's also a whole
04:15:59.760 bunch of different tools that I won't
04:16:01.800 cover in this video that can help assist
04:16:04.199 with you guys getting getting capital
04:16:06.279 and leveraging your Capital like The
04:16:08.600 Brokerage that I that I showed you guys
04:16:10.640 that's a really good place to start okay
04:16:13.720 in terms of leveraging your own Capital
04:16:15.560 so this is how I would be risking based
04:16:17.920 on whatever type of Trader you are and
04:16:20.439 if you're saying well how do I know what
04:16:21.720 type of Trader are I am well you simply
04:16:24.080 just look at these statistics and you're
04:16:25.880 saying well how do I find these
04:16:27.319 statistics you got a journal your trades
04:16:30.399 so that leads me into the next thing
04:16:33.239 which is going to help us with
04:16:34.319 psychology and which is a perfect merger
04:16:37.199 over to the very last skill set that we
04:16:40.439 need to learn in order to be a
04:16:41.640 profitable Trader yes I know you're
04:16:43.399 seeing the video is being clo close to
04:16:45.399 being done don't worry you're almost
04:16:47.040 there you're almost there I promise you
04:16:48.800 you're almost there okay you're almost
04:16:50.640 freaking there so you want to figure out
04:16:53.960 what's my average risk reward what's my
04:16:56.040 average win rate you got to journal your
04:16:58.880 trades and this is going to be super
04:17:00.920 helpful when it comes to psychology and
04:17:02.640 managing your emotions within the market
04:17:04.720 and this is also going to be super
04:17:05.920 helpful when trying to figure this out
04:17:07.760 so what are what what are the pieces of
04:17:09.520 data that you guys want to be tracking
04:17:11.119 in your trading journal the first thing
04:17:13.880 the amount of game that I'm dropping on
04:17:15.520 this video is actually [ __ ] it's
04:17:17.920 actually insane how how in-depth I'm
04:17:19.880 going in on this
04:17:21.359 bro I haven't I haven't done this in a
04:17:23.800 while I haven't done a I I actually
04:17:25.680 don't think I've ever done this this
04:17:27.720 full comprehensive A to Z trading in one
04:17:32.199 single video before I don't think I've
04:17:33.960 ever done this this is by far the
04:17:35.720 longest video that I've dropped crazy
04:17:37.680 amount of game going on right now be
04:17:39.960 blessed it's actually nuts how I would
04:17:43.040 have paid bro I would have paid I would
04:17:45.680 have paid two to like
04:17:47.840 $33,000 for this just this video back
04:17:51.520 when I was learning how to trade thank
04:17:54.159 God I am my like old unprofitable self

04:18:07.520 guys so shout out old unprofitable Tyler
04:18:11.199 anyways in my trade journal what am I
04:18:13.439 going to mark down whether I won or

04:18:19.760 thing whoa chill what pair
04:18:24.960 what what
04:18:26.960 pair what pair did you trade trade on
04:18:30.960 what was your
04:18:32.840 bias
04:18:34.359 so what key levels did you think price
04:18:36.960 was going to go into why did you take
04:18:38.920 the trade what were your
04:18:41.159 confluences okay we need to understand

04:18:55.319 trade what was your risk to
04:19:03.680 reward what was your risk reward and
04:19:06.080 post nut Clarity no this is not a joke

04:19:25.439 [ __ ] as Market is opening slowly
04:19:28.159 stroking slowly gaining an
04:19:31.080 erection and after you placed your trade
04:19:34.520 you realize it's all over the screen and
04:19:36.520 you have post nut Clarity you have post
04:19:40.119 trade clarity
04:19:42.840 and you need to write down what your
04:19:44.199 post trade Clarity
04:19:45.920 is just like how in those
04:19:49.680 moments when at the time you're hammered
04:19:52.399 you're blackout drunk and you see a
04:19:54.880 whale and you got to put up a buzzer

04:21:52.279 should and would do it
04:21:54.800 again that's a w trade but at the
04:21:58.640 beginning of the dating scene you're
04:22:00.960 [ __ ] everything okay the post nut
04:22:03.479 clarities are going to hit hard just
04:22:05.720 like your post trade clarities are going
04:22:07.239 to hit real [ __ ] hard for you guys
04:22:09.080 okay you guys are going to be like what
04:22:10.680 the [ __ ] was I thinking on this trade
04:22:12.840 because your emotions got the best of
04:22:14.159 you your psychology you're all [ __ ] up
04:22:16.279 because you're so excited to take a
04:22:17.560 trade you're so excited to just get your
04:22:19.319 nut off you're so horny and you don't
04:22:22.239 think about what you're doing in the
04:22:23.800 moment until you're an experienced
04:22:26.960 rizzler and you get into the bar and
04:22:29.159 you're like fat [ __ ] fat [ __ ] Cho
04:22:32.680 [ __ ] ugly [ __ ] maybe a 35 Old
04:22:36.000 35-year-old [ __ ] don't want him dime
04:22:39.119 piece in the corner the only one in the
04:22:42.119 bar that's
04:22:43.920 attractive that's the trade that I want
04:22:45.960 to take and you're
04:22:47.840 maneuvering
04:22:49.479 ducking fat [ __ ] sweaty [ __ ] ugly
04:22:52.279 [ __ ] chopped [ __ ] get them away I
04:22:56.560 don't want to see them cuz you have your
04:22:59.040 eyes on the prize and that's what being
04:23:00.720 a profitable Trader is about it's about
04:23:03.279 sifting weaving through the fat [ __ ]
04:23:06.359 and hitting that hitting that winning
04:23:09.800 trade it's about sifting and in weaving
04:23:13.439 through all the bad trades not taking
04:23:16.560 them not letting your horniness get the
04:23:18.640 best of you Tunnel Vision on the bad
04:23:20.880 [ __ ] Tunnel Vision on the good trade
04:23:23.880 and taking that trade every single time
04:23:26.359 but as we know profitable Traders we
04:23:29.800 have our
04:23:31.560 flaws sometimes we take bad trades
04:23:34.399 sometimes we got to get that nut off and
04:23:36.600 then we know exactly the mistakes that
04:23:38.640 we made and we write them down in our
04:23:41.040 post- trade Clarity and that is how how
04:23:42.560 you Journal your trades okay we need to
04:23:45.520 journal our trades in order to
04:23:47.439 understand our emotions in order to
04:23:49.119 understand
04:23:49.960 our in order to understand our win rate
04:23:53.119 and also to understand our risk reward
04:23:55.920 okay because over time you guys are
04:23:57.080 going to be able to figure out what your
04:23:58.399 average win rate is and what your
04:24:00.159 average risk reward is and you're also
04:24:02.080 going to be figuring out damn every time
04:24:04.479 I take a trade off of a order [ __ ] and
04:24:07.439 equilibrium or whatever every time I
04:24:09.600 take a trade like this I [ __ ] lose
04:24:12.920 but every time I take a trade off of
04:24:15.359 this I win huh it must not be a
04:24:19.800 coincidence write it down take a note of
04:24:22.399 it and don't make the same mistake again
04:24:24.439 now we have to get into the very last
04:24:27.439 piece of being a profitable Trader which
04:24:29.960 is psychology and it's by far probably
04:24:31.800 one of the at least for me it was the
04:24:34.600 hardest concept to get over and it was
04:24:36.159 by far the hardest skill to grow within
04:24:37.720 my trading and it and and it's one of
04:24:39.319 the hardest skills to grow in life so
04:24:41.760 before you guys just think okay I'm said
04:24:43.359 and done I know risk management I know
04:24:44.960 strategy no you guys don't know it all
04:24:46.920 yet because trust me I knew risk
04:24:48.960 management I knew strategy but the one
04:24:51.840 thing that that took forever for me to
04:24:53.840 get over within my trading career was
04:24:56.199 psychology so I don't like me personally
04:24:59.399 I can't let you guys go yet I know this
04:25:01.000 video has been really [ __ ] long and
04:25:02.279 thank you guys for sticking around okay
04:25:04.720 but I I really do need you guys to stay
04:25:07.319 stay just a little bit longer so I can
04:25:08.920 Grill you guys on your own psychology
04:25:10.760 right now you guys have horrible
04:25:11.920 psychology ology right now and I can
04:25:13.239 tell it even without being day Traders
04:25:15.040 you guys have horrible
04:25:16.520 psychology okay and it is my goal to fix
04:25:19.920 that and or at least give you guys the
04:25:22.760 tools to hopefully get over that really
04:25:26.319 shitty Psychology okay so let's get into
04:25:30.319 this all right no more chart work just
04:25:33.439 psychology work and this is probably
04:25:35.439 going to be one of either the most
04:25:38.080 important lessons or you guys completely
04:25:39.680 skip this lesson and you guys don't
04:25:41.640 learn [ __ ] and you guys just will not
04:25:45.119 you just don't make it in day trading
04:25:46.840 just plain and simple so I guess what
04:25:49.520 I'll do is I'll kind of first paint the
04:25:53.119 picture of uh where I was before trading
04:25:56.920 and kind of like how I built myself up
04:25:59.359 to be where I'm at now so when I first
04:26:03.319 started day trading for me I was very uh
04:26:07.640 like [ __ ] the system I mean as you guys
04:26:09.840 saw from that little liquidity sweep
04:26:12.359 mention on the monthly time frame you
04:26:14.439 know I'm I'm very against against the
04:26:17.199 system that's just who I am I I hate
04:26:19.359 being told what to do I just hate having
04:26:21.600 like the my biggest pet peeve was my
04:26:23.359 parents telling me I couldn't do
04:26:24.600 something or telling me what to do and
04:26:26.319 me being pissed off like why do I have
04:26:27.880 to do this [ __ ] I don't want to do this
04:26:29.479 [ __ ] I want to do what I want to do and
04:26:32.000 to this day that's exactly how I am and
04:26:34.960 that's why I think trading and then also
04:26:37.920 crypto enticed me was because this is is
04:26:41.520 such a [ __ ] this system game it's so
04:26:44.560 like you know nobody can tell me nothing
04:26:47.479 because I'm making money in my own house
04:26:51.600 on my own there's there's no other
04:26:53.479 variables and the only person to blame
04:26:56.080 for a for a losing trade and the only
04:26:58.319 person to blame for losing money is
04:27:00.439 myself so there's really no other
04:27:03.359 factors to look towards or to point
04:27:06.840 towards when a trade is lost besides you
04:27:10.680 should have done better you did
04:27:12.359 something wrong and I love that about
04:27:14.319 trading where I was like okay this is
04:27:16.640 awesome so the only person that matters
04:27:19.159 in this is myself that sounds a little
04:27:21.119 bit narcissistic but you kind of do have
04:27:23.920 to think that way where it's like okay
04:27:26.880 this is one I understood that it was the
04:27:30.040 the scalability and The Leverage that
04:27:31.840 this skill was going to be able to give
04:27:33.279 me I saw that and I understood if I can
04:27:36.479 learn this skill I can make just
04:27:39.720 infinite amounts of money and the only
04:27:42.439 thing that is limiting myself is me so
04:27:46.199 with that knowledge I was like okay all
04:27:49.040 that all that I have to do is work on
04:27:51.159 myself now work on what is required so I
04:27:55.040 need to understand how this strategy
04:27:57.880 [ __ ] Works what what what causes the
04:28:00.119 markets to move and it took me a long
04:28:01.800 time to figure that out luckily for you
04:28:03.920 you guys you guys have a mentor like me
04:28:06.000 that's just giv given everything to you
04:28:08.319 guys in one freaking video so you're
04:28:10.279 welcome but back then I didn't have have
04:28:12.399 that I was going from YouTube channel to
04:28:14.760 YouTube channel to YouTube channel
04:28:17.319 trying to figure out like first of all
04:28:18.640 is this dude even [ __ ] legit like can
04:28:20.680 I trust this person um because that's
04:28:23.080 just the day and age that we live in and
04:28:25.119 then second of all not only can I trust
04:28:27.960 this person but is what they are
04:28:30.439 teaching going to work for me and do
04:28:33.199 they have everything necessary on their
04:28:35.640 YouTube channel for me to actually learn
04:28:37.720 how to do this [ __ ] and it was just just
04:28:40.880 scrounging and scrounging and
04:28:52.000 scringy Graham okay I was reading all
04:28:54.840 these different types of books I was
04:28:56.520 watching all these videos and I probably
04:28:58.239 spent like there I I actually vividly
04:29:00.479 remember the week that I that I got into
04:29:02.439 day trading I I watched probably like 30
04:29:05.080 hours worth of YouTube so that's like
04:29:07.279 essentially full-time that's like
04:29:08.800 full-time job of YouTube of me learning
04:29:11.760 how to day trade and that was just the
04:29:13.720 first week of me getting into it it it
04:29:15.600 went way higher after that but I just
04:29:17.199 remember like looking back at like how
04:29:19.600 like all the videos that I watched and I
04:29:20.880 was like damn this is a lot I was just
04:29:22.560 that infatuated with it so after getting
04:29:25.760 all the information and at the time
04:29:28.080 there was really nobody that was talking
04:29:29.800 about psychology and mental discipline
04:29:31.720 and emotional discipline within the
04:29:33.880 markets I was like awesome I know how to
04:29:36.439 trade I or at at the time I thought I
04:29:38.880 knew how to trade this thing and I went
04:29:40.600 in I deposited some money and what
04:29:44.760 happened I lost all of it within the
04:29:46.600 first day and you're probably saying how
04:29:48.080 is that even possible well I thought I
04:29:50.920 knew how to trade and I tried to take
04:29:55.520 like literally 10 to 30 different trades
04:29:58.600 in a single day and as you guys know now
04:30:01.080 that's not smart you guys should only be
04:30:02.800 taking like one or two trades in a day
04:30:05.760 because again if we're only if we're
04:30:08.159 risking 1 to 3% of our account per per
04:30:11.439 day you know how how how much does that
04:30:13.960 even give us to work with not much right
04:30:16.760 and also if we're only trading from 950
04:30:18.960 to 10:30 you know typically there's only
04:30:21.359 one setup that's going to happen within
04:30:23.279 that time so I didn't have a mentor to
04:30:25.840 tell me this stuff and I was looking for
04:30:27.560 trades 24/7 within the market I was
04:30:30.159 looking for trades during Asian session
04:30:31.520 I was looking for trades during London
04:30:32.680 session I was looking for trades during
04:30:33.840 New York session and I was like what the
04:30:36.600 [ __ ] man why is why is this not working
04:30:38.520 why are things not going in my favor I
04:30:40.040 thought I did all this I I did all this
04:30:41.520 research for nothing this thing's not
04:30:42.920 working but I was still determined I was
04:30:44.439 like I I want this to work really bad
04:30:46.119 because I know the potential that I that
04:30:47.800 I can have in this I was just going and
04:30:50.560 going and going and I just kept losing
04:30:52.479 these trades and then I figured out risk
04:30:53.920 management and I was like okay cool I
04:30:55.640 know how much I'm supposed to risk per
04:30:57.080 day so I I I wrote down I even have my
04:31:00.840 old notebook back when I was learning
04:31:02.640 how to trade and look at this I have my
04:31:04.640 trading plan written out right here this
04:31:06.640 is from way back in the day I had all
04:31:10.080 the days that I was willing to trade um
04:31:12.720 you know I look at look at this right
04:31:14.760 here risk 1 to 3% Max per trade so I
04:31:19.479 figured out risk management okay and I
04:31:22.439 figured out this is like my strategy at
04:31:24.479 the time this is [ __ ] by the way so
04:31:26.279 don't try and read the strategy and
04:31:27.640 think it's good but I was writing down
04:31:29.159 all these things that were going to be
04:31:30.920 helpful for me to potentially get me to
04:31:32.840 the next level cuz I really wanted this
04:31:34.399 [ __ ] I mean as you can see I was a
04:31:36.000 little bit manic um you know I'm saying
04:31:39.080 calculate risk to reward before entering
04:31:41.399 set up stop loss before entering don't
04:31:44.159 move your stop- loss back I was
04:31:45.800 struggling I was struggling I was moving
04:31:47.520 my stop- loss back because I was like no
04:31:49.119 this trade has to go in my direction and
04:31:51.920 I was dealing with all of these emotions
04:31:54.720 of greed of fear of
04:31:58.080 overconfidence of underconfidence and it
04:32:01.199 was just this back and forth of like
04:32:02.800 Euphoria despair Euphoria despair I
04:32:05.359 would hit a winning trade and I'll would
04:32:06.640 be like what the [ __ ] this is the this
04:32:08.199 is the greatest thing ever I'm going to
04:32:09.479 be a billionaire and I'm going to take
04:32:10.960 three more trades and then lose the rest
04:32:12.800 of those trades and then I'm back to
04:32:14.279 despair mode and I'm like man I don't
04:32:16.159 think this is going to work and I'm sure
04:32:18.199 if you guys have already been in trading
04:32:19.880 for a little bit now you guys have
04:32:21.840 experienced these emotions before and
04:32:25.000 this was just this this this constant
04:32:26.720 cycle this constant cycle and and it
04:32:28.520 actually got to the point where I I got
04:32:30.199 pretty good at trading where my strategy
04:32:33.000 was pretty freaking solid I it got like
04:32:35.800 I mean my strategy now is more advanced
04:32:38.119 than what it was at the time when I was
04:32:39.640 first turning profitable or like getting
04:32:41.399 good at trading but it was kind of a
04:32:43.040 variation of what I just taught you guys
04:32:45.040 just a little bit uh a lot worse
04:32:46.880 actually but it was a variation of this
04:32:48.800 of understanding the markets and uh my
04:32:52.359 risk management was on was on point to
04:32:54.800 an extent there would still be those
04:32:56.520 times or emotions with get the best of
04:32:58.159 me but for the most part I was like okay
04:33:00.040 I understand where the Market's going to
04:33:01.600 go like decently well where like I can
04:33:03.720 make pretty accurate predictions and
04:33:05.320 honestly like my win rate was there it
04:33:06.958 was at like 60 to 70% it was a pretty
04:33:09.000 solid win rate but my biggest issue man
04:33:11.240 my big and worst issue was my emotions
04:33:13.719 my emotions just kept getting the best
04:33:15.199 of me and there was a specific time
04:33:18.199 where this will like I mean it haunts me
04:33:21.278 forever but it made me the trader that I
04:33:23.118 am
04:33:23.879 today I I had $10,000 in a trading
04:33:26.958 account and I turned that $10,000 into
04:33:31.359 $112,000 over the span of two [ __ ]
04:33:34.320 days two days it took for me to go to
04:33:36.599 $10,000 to $112,000 and I know every
04:33:39.320 single one of you guys watching this
04:33:40.719 video is like holy [ __ ] I can do that
04:33:42.359 too he's going to give me the secret to
04:33:44.080 how I can do it guess what happened the
04:33:45.919 very next day I lost all of it I lost
04:33:49.118 every single dollar the account balance
04:33:51.039 said
04:33:52.359 zero you're probably saying the account
04:33:54.480 got
04:33:55.278 hacked brokerage ran off with your money
04:33:59.639 nope I lost all of the money day
04:34:03.320 trading and it was because my emotions
04:34:06.599 got the best of me I was on this high
04:34:10.680 rise of euphoria
04:34:12.919 I was thinking man life is good I'm
04:34:16.080 winning these trades I keep making more
04:34:18.240 and more money with every single trade
04:34:20.958 that I take I'm just going to keep
04:34:22.561 increasing my risk because I can't stop
04:34:25.680 winning until the winning stopped that
04:34:29.118 $112,000 would have changed my life like
04:34:32.561 literally
04:34:35.639 forever but me losing that $112,000
04:34:41.759 changed my life even more than if I had
04:34:45.118 kept that and it was the lessons that
04:34:48.359 losing that 12
04:34:49.840 $22,000 did to me that turned me into
04:34:52.320 the trader that I am now and that was
04:34:56.799 the probably the worst period of life
04:34:59.958 that I went through I like that $10,000
04:35:04.400 was literally all the money that I had
04:35:06.919 um and it that loss caused me to go into
04:35:12.039 severe
04:35:12.958 depression I tried to take my life and I
04:35:16.680 know there's a lot of you guys that are

04:35:46.719 help me um I had a bad relationship with
04:35:50.240 my parents at the time um didn't really
04:35:54.039 have a good relationship with my
04:35:55.480 siblings there and I I had no [ __ ]
04:35:59.400 friends I was just like this nerd ass
04:36:03.520 dude at least like I just had this weird
04:36:06.080 obsession with trading and I had nobody
04:36:07.599 to [ __ ] talk to I had no money and I
04:36:10.759 was struggling really [ __ ] bad
04:36:14.400 and at that point in time I was like I
04:36:17.840 just I hate my life so much I just want
04:36:20.958 my life to be
04:36:24.958 over and that was
04:36:29.599 like can't help myself from crying bro
04:36:32.480 cuz God damn bro like that [ __ ] worked
04:36:39.080 like I don't do this um
04:36:44.759 bro like I tried to take my life and I
04:36:46.759 tried to take my life multiple
04:36:48.480 times
04:36:50.759 and like it was I was in such a horrible
04:36:55.639 place um I was I was in a horrible Place
04:36:59.400 mentally and I I just like I felt like
04:37:01.240 nobody was there for
04:37:02.719 me and like the one thing that I loved
04:37:06.240 just kind of let me down which was
04:37:08.680 trading and I quit trading for 3 months
04:37:12.080 after that and like was just so
04:37:14.958 depressed and was just in this like just
04:37:17.438 huge period of like what the [ __ ] am I
04:37:19.118 on this Earth for like what like what
04:37:21.958 the [ __ ] am I
04:37:24.359 doing
04:37:27.438 and oh
04:37:29.400 man like I literally remember exactly
04:37:32.320 where I was
04:37:33.359 sitting when all this [ __ ] was going
04:37:35.799 through my
04:37:37.919 head I feel like such [ __ ] oh I've
04:37:40.919 already done this sh before bro in a
04:37:42.680 video and
04:37:44.000 it
04:37:46.400 ah but I remember that exact position
04:37:49.000 that I was sitting in when like all that
04:37:50.639 [ __ ] was going through my head and like
04:37:52.480 I genuinely did not want to be on the
04:37:54.039 earth anymore and I hated my life and I
04:37:56.799 was just thinking like
04:37:59.000 man like I I just want to like figure
04:38:01.639 out what the [ __ ] I'm supposed to
04:38:04.039 do and luckily for me like I had already
04:38:06.680 been in crypto before and I had a decent
04:38:10.919 amount of money crypto and like there
04:38:14.278 was just like that that 3 months was
04:38:16.039 horrible I I attempted to take my life I
04:38:18.080 was in like dead um there was a point in
04:38:22.039 time where I had negative $2,000 in my
04:38:24.080 bank account and I was literally like
04:38:27.680 bro I was [ __ ] door dashing
04:38:30.759 like just trying to pay off that debt
04:38:34.240 and I was looking up all these different
04:38:35.958 [ __ ] door Dash hacks like I would to
04:38:37.759 make the most amount of money on door
04:38:39.438 Dash and I would bro like I I literally
04:38:41.719 didn't have a [ __ ] life I was
04:38:43.359 donating [ __ ] plasma and [ __ ] like it
04:38:46.160 and I'm sure a lot of you guys you guys
04:38:48.118 are probably in that same exact position
04:38:49.759 right
04:38:50.840 now and man did life [ __ ] suck at
04:38:54.879 that point in time but crypto started
04:38:57.680 picking back up and I couldn't help but
04:39:00.320 like look at the charts and I was
04:39:02.520 looking at the crypto charts and I was
04:39:04.080 like man like okay yeah like price is
04:39:06.680 going up I'm making some money that I
04:39:08.520 had invested like a while ago like like
04:39:11.719 okay like things are kind of turning
04:39:13.320 around and then I started drawing some
04:39:14.759 chart some chart work up on the charts
04:39:17.160 and I'm like man like this is uh it kind
04:39:19.480 of like brought some energy back in me
04:39:21.278 and I was like starting to get happy
04:39:22.680 again and I was like man
04:39:24.561 like what if I can actually make this
04:39:26.759 [ __ ]
04:39:27.719 work what if you can actually make this
04:39:29.879 [ __ ]
04:39:30.840 work and that was just like the question
04:39:32.840 that like just kept running through my
04:39:34.278 head bro and again I just like these are
04:39:37.560 just like core [ __ ] memories in my
04:39:39.360 head like I I can like perfectly
04:39:40.958 envision
04:39:41.878 where I was sitting down when I was
04:39:43.080 thinking these
04:39:45.280 things like literally on my [ __ ] trap
04:39:47.798 ass iPad and I'm marking this [ __ ] up
04:39:51.360 and I'm like okay [ __ ] it like I I got
04:39:55.520 to give this [ __ ] one more shot and the
04:39:57.958 biggest thing that losing that
04:40:00.200 $112,000 gave me
04:40:03.160 was I I hit rock bottom and I just
04:40:07.840 learned like I never want to go back to
04:40:10.120 that position ever again I never want to
04:40:12.120 go back to that head space ever again
04:40:14.160 and I'm happy when I'm day trading I'm
04:40:16.200 happy when I'm learning about this I'm
04:40:18.240 happy when I'm doing it I'm happy right
04:40:20.680 now I'm happy when I'm teaching it I I
04:40:23.840 [ __ ] love day trading probably more
04:40:26.360 than like literally any I mean like I
04:40:28.718 would like to say my love day trading is
04:40:30.480 more than the majority of people's um I
04:40:34.040 love those goddamn charts so much they
04:40:36.120 saved my life
04:40:38.920 and I like I just wanted to make make
04:40:41.440 this [ __ ] work so I told myself okay I
04:40:45.000 know what not to do now I know not to be
04:40:47.638 over risking I know not to move my
04:40:51.240 freaking stop loss I know to set my stop
04:40:55.040 loss before I enter I know to risk 1 to
04:40:58.560 3% Max per
04:41:01.120 trade okay and I I know to journal every
04:41:06.320 trade and I I mean even right here I
04:41:09.400 review your losses screenshot your
04:41:11.878 trades before and after and put it in
04:41:13.560 the spreadsheet like I I wrote all these
04:41:15.600 things down and I um that was like the
04:41:18.320 turning point for me was just saying
04:41:21.400 okay I really really [ __ ] want this
04:41:23.680 [ __ ] to work and I know a lot of you
04:41:26.080 guys are probably in that position now
04:41:28.480 and you know maybe you do have to hit
04:41:31.000 rock bottom to get it through your heads
04:41:33.600 of what you are supposed to do and what
04:41:36.040 you're not supposed to do within the
04:41:37.320 market like I had
04:41:38.878 to but ideally I went through all that
04:41:42.080 suffering for you guys for you guys to
04:41:45.120 learn from all the [ __ ] that I had to go
04:41:49.160 through because I didn't have a mentor
04:41:51.560 like myself when I was when I started
04:41:53.680 day trading and that's what I hope that
04:41:56.360 I could be for you guys like I was
04:41:57.840 saying before I'm like my unprofitable
04:42:01.200 self's favorite Mentor cuz these videos
04:42:04.520 would have hit so hard for him and
04:42:06.638 hopefully they're doing the same for
04:42:09.400 you so
04:42:12.160 that was like the head space that I was
04:42:14.040 in going
04:42:15.638 from I know strategy I know risk
04:42:18.160 management but my psychology is [ __ ]
04:42:20.080 up and it's causing me to take bad
04:42:22.120 trades it's causing me to over risk it's
04:42:23.840 causing me to move my stop- loss it's
04:42:25.400 causing me to trade without a stoploss
04:42:27.920 what the [ __ ] is wrong with me and then
04:42:29.240 I boom I get smacked in the [ __ ] face
04:42:31.440 by life and by trading the markets are
04:42:33.520 unforgiving they'll smack you in the
04:42:34.958 face and they'll take everything that
04:42:36.360 you have if you aren't on top of your
04:42:38.958 [ __ ] and I'm telling you this right the
04:42:41.560 [ __ ] now because I literally tried to
04:42:43.400 take my life because of what the markets
04:42:45.760 did to me more like what I did to myself
04:42:48.560 what my mental did to myself so you guys
04:42:51.320 hopefully don't have to go through that
04:42:53.200 and I'm going to lay out every single
04:42:55.320 thing mentally that I wish I
04:42:58.840 knew before it happened to me so you
04:43:03.440 guys don't have to go through that same
04:43:04.680 pain and that same suffering the first
04:43:07.000 thing that I wish I did was just
04:43:09.000 developing emotional discipline and what
04:43:11.520 does that even mean we as humans are
04:43:13.760 just emotional ass creatures okay
04:43:16.920 typically when we act based off of
04:43:18.638 emotion it's the wrong decision when
04:43:20.600 we're acting based off of emotions we're
04:43:22.320 not acting based off a data we're not B
04:43:24.840 acting based off of like the analytics
04:43:26.480 and the data that is being given to us
04:43:28.400 we're acting based off of just the Fe
04:43:30.160 like the feeling that it's making us if
04:43:31.638 we're angry we we might punch someone if
04:43:34.000 we're sad like what whatever we're going
04:43:36.600 to like be in a bad mood towards people
04:43:40.360 okay if we're greedy we're going to
04:43:43.040 extend our take
04:43:44.878 profit okay if we're fearful we might
04:43:47.280 not take that
04:43:49.600 trade
04:43:51.160 and more often than not when we listen
04:43:54.560 to our emotions and when we act based
04:43:56.440 off of our emotions besides in
04:43:58.320 relationships it's a stupid ass decision
04:44:00.840 or actually no I take that back even
04:44:04.080 even more so in relationships we need to
04:44:06.080 be acting based off of data and
04:44:08.600 analytics what is happening
04:44:11.638 what is in front of me what has
04:44:14.120 happened and what should I do because of
04:44:16.440 it not how am I feeling about this
04:44:18.280 situation cuz how you're feeling is
04:44:20.480 going to cause you to take the take the
04:44:22.320 wrong action how was I
04:44:25.120 feeling after I lost
04:44:28.280 $112,000 that would have changed my
04:44:31.840 life the actions that I took after that
04:44:35.360 were very poor decisions and were
04:44:37.400 emotional decisions super emotional
04:44:39.718 decisions
04:44:42.120 versus if I just went off based off the
04:44:43.878 data and said damn you're still a young
04:44:46.200 ass kid you still you still understand
04:44:48.840 this skill you got knocked down you can
04:44:51.360 get the you can get back up this isn't
04:44:53.280 the end of the [ __ ] world you still
04:44:54.840 got this bro I would have turned I would
04:44:57.480 have turned my [ __ ] around way quicker
04:44:59.040 than the three months that it took for
04:45:00.200 me to get up and get on the charts again
04:45:03.600 but I was making stupid emotional ass
04:45:05.638 decisions and the same thing applies to
04:45:07.718 trading if we lose a trade we can't get
04:45:10.240 pissed off and then try and go make that
04:45:12.798 money back immediately no we have to
04:45:14.878 learn from our loss and we have to Boom
04:45:17.600 take ourselves out of the market for
04:45:19.240 that day understand that losses happen
04:45:21.120 in trading and they're okay we should
04:45:22.798 welcome losses because it's a lesson for
04:45:24.560 us to learn learn from that lesson and
04:45:27.360 never make it again learn from that
04:45:28.958 mistake and never make it again oh damn
04:45:30.480 I risked more than I should have okay
04:45:33.680 that's okay did I lose more money than I
04:45:36.360 than I probably would have wanted yes
04:45:38.160 but that's okay I'm going I that's fine
04:45:40.560 it's a a little bit more money than I
04:45:41.718 would have liked to but guess what
04:45:43.200 that's a learning experience and I'm
04:45:45.600 never going to let that happen again and
04:45:47.798 because I'm never going to let that
04:45:49.080 happened to me again that is going to
04:45:51.600 cause me to make way more money than
04:45:53.360 that loss cost me if we're greedy when
04:45:55.798 we extend take profits when we should
04:45:57.480 have closed a trade position that should
04:45:59.560 have hit our takeprofit but we extended
04:46:01.320 it because we wanted to make more money
04:46:03.320 and then boom it hits our key level that
04:46:06.200 we should have taken profit on and price
04:46:09.240 goes right back to your stop loss and
04:46:10.718 you lose money you just paid for a
04:46:13.718 lesson bro you paid for a lesson in the
04:46:16.240 market and you can sit you can cry and
04:46:19.280 you can immediately force yourself back
04:46:21.080 into the market and you can look for
04:46:22.320 another trade or you can say look I need
04:46:25.520 to understand that that was my one trade
04:46:27.840 for the day I risked what I said I was
04:46:30.600 going to risk I lost because I let them
04:46:34.440 my emotions get the best of me I took
04:46:36.160 actions based on my emotions because I'm
04:46:39.200 emotionally attached to money we have to
04:46:42.000 emotionally detach ourselves from money
04:46:44.638 if we think about trading as I'm not
04:46:48.120 looking to make money but I'm just
04:46:49.760 looking to predict price action on a
04:46:51.400 daily basis with high probability boom
04:46:54.000 you got it that is how you become a
04:46:56.920 profitable day trader not how can I make
04:46:59.160 money today because if I go into the
04:47:00.520 markets thinking how can I make money
04:47:02.000 today I get into the markets and if I
04:47:04.320 lose money then my goal hasn't been
04:47:06.080 completed and I'm going to keep trying
04:47:07.840 keep trying keep trying until my goal
04:47:09.240 has been completed but what's that going
04:47:10.480 to do that's going to leave me in the
04:47:11.798 [ __ ] dirt cuz if I lose the first
04:47:14.120 trade then that means I have to go back
04:47:15.760 and win a trade that's not only worth
04:47:17.760 the loss of the first trade but also
04:47:19.958 more than that so I can make my end goal
04:47:22.080 and what is that next trade going to
04:47:23.680 lead me to do probably lose more money
04:47:26.000 what's the trade after that going to do
04:47:27.558 probably lose more money and that's the
04:47:29.400 exact lesson that I learned when I lost
04:47:31.000 six [ __ ] figures so I'm telling you
04:47:33.120 guys right now don't let your emotions
04:47:34.558 get the best of you the the emotions
04:47:36.638 that you guys are going to deal deal
04:47:38.160 with are fear greed euphoria
04:47:41.400 [ __ ] despair you guys are going to go
04:47:43.280 through Lo losing streaks and think man
04:47:45.440 I can't get this [ __ ] I need to change
04:47:47.000 my strategy [ __ ] no you don't have to
04:47:48.718 change your strategy you need to put in
04:47:50.320 more work that's what you're lacking
04:47:52.958 you're lacking the work and the
04:47:54.520 discipline to stick to the lessons that
04:47:56.200 you already learn that in the mistakes
04:47:57.920 that you keep making over and over and
04:47:59.360 over and over and over and over over
04:48:01.160 again the second that you guys can stop
04:48:03.400 making the same mistakes over and over
04:48:05.000 again and the second that you guys have
04:48:06.400 the emotional discipline to say [ __ ] no
04:48:08.400 to those lessons and [ __ ] no to those
04:48:10.840 mistakes that's when you improve those
04:48:13.280 are that's when you crash through the
04:48:14.920 brick wall and that's when you get to
04:48:16.440 the next level there's mistakes and
04:48:18.480 there's problems at the next level just
04:48:20.000 like I was telling you guys about but
04:48:22.280 trust me those problems are the problems
04:48:24.200 that you got you are going to want to
04:48:25.878 deal with I don't have to worry about
04:48:28.360 the problem of being an unprofitable
04:48:30.200 Trader anymore I have to worry about the
04:48:32.600 problem of how much money am I going to
04:48:34.320 risk on this day how much money am I
04:48:36.520 willing to lose on this day is it going
04:48:38.360 to be $155,000 is it going to be20
04:48:41.040 $5,000 is it going to be $10,000 is it
04:48:43.400 going to be $5,000 and I think back to
04:48:45.760 when I was a unprofitable day trader oh
04:48:48.638 man I would have loved to be dealing
04:48:50.000 with those problems that I'm dealing
04:48:51.000 with now but you first have to overcome
04:48:53.240 the problems at your level and the
04:48:54.718 problems that you guys are going to deal
04:48:56.040 with is just these emotions bro they get
04:48:59.320 the best of you and I'm telling you you
04:49:02.120 probably don't know it yet but you will
04:49:04.160 when you get onto the charts and you
04:49:05.440 take your first trade and you win and
04:49:06.840 you get all amped up and you're like man
04:49:08.280 I want to take another one no
04:49:11.440 you can't take another one you won on
04:49:13.520 the day you beat a market that 99% of
04:49:16.360 people can't beat take your money and
04:49:18.760 leave you lost money on the day too bad
04:49:22.200 so sad if you have a good win rate if
04:49:24.958 you have a good risk reward ratio you're
04:49:26.680 net profitable why are you crying don't
04:49:29.400 be butt hurt don't try and make money
04:49:31.200 every single day don't let your emotions
04:49:32.638 get the best of you stick to your
04:49:34.480 [ __ ] trading plan this is number two
04:49:37.120 number one emotional discipline learn to
04:49:39.878 detach yourself from the money your goal
04:49:42.320 isn't to make money in trading your goal
04:49:44.080 is to be right about where price wants
04:49:46.160 to go if you can just be right about
04:49:48.240 where price wants to go boom you're set
04:49:50.120 for life if you have that skill next one
04:49:51.958 is sticking to your trading plan I just
04:49:54.200 went over the exact trading plan that
04:49:55.718 you guys should be following if you guys
04:49:58.040 can't stick to that and if you guys are
04:49:59.360 getting into trades before you guys
04:50:00.760 should boom that's a discipline issue
04:50:03.040 know where you're going to place your
04:50:04.360 stop- loss know where you're going to
04:50:05.920 get in know where you're going to get
04:50:07.600 out in both directions if if the trade
04:50:10.240 starts going in the opposite direction
04:50:12.320 that I think I have to know exactly
04:50:14.320 where I'm going to get out and I have to
04:50:15.638 place a stop loss on with a price point
04:50:18.240 of saying I am going to lose this amount
04:50:20.080 of money right here and that's where my
04:50:21.440 trade idea gets invalidated and if it
04:50:23.200 gets hit then there's no reason to even
04:50:24.920 look for another trade because my idea
04:50:26.798 is gone my idea was wrong for the day
04:50:30.280 and the same thing if you enter into a
04:50:32.718 trade and your idea is right you better
04:50:34.840 [ __ ] get paid for it and you better
04:50:37.120 not let your emotions get the best of
04:50:38.520 you for you trying to make more stick to
04:50:41.558 your trading plan next one is managing
04:50:43.840 your fear and greed a lot of you
04:50:47.440 guys it's it's funny because you guys
04:50:50.000 won't deal with this on demo but you
04:50:51.558 guys will deal with this the second that
04:50:53.400 you move to a live account if you guys
04:50:54.718 are profitable on demo that's step one
04:50:56.878 step two is going from profitable on
04:50:59.160 demo to profitable on a live account
04:51:01.240 it's two different things because on
04:51:02.718 demo it's fake money who cares if you
04:51:04.600 lose who cares if you win but on a live
04:51:06.958 account that's your hard-earned money
04:51:08.798 that you've been working your ass off
04:51:10.600 for so you care if you lose you care if
04:51:13.480 you win but that's the problem you can't
04:51:16.160 care you can't care if you win you can't
04:51:18.600 care if you lose you have to be
04:51:19.680 emotionless and the problem is if you
04:51:21.558 care about when you lose you're going to
04:51:22.958 be Fe fearful it's going to lead to
04:51:25.120 hesitation in the market it's going to
04:51:27.080 lead to missed opportunities it's going
04:51:29.360 to lead to you guys hovering over the
04:51:31.080 buy button but you're just freaking out
04:51:32.480 because you're like man I don't want to
04:51:33.520 lose this hundred bucks and then boom
04:51:36.440 price goes in the direction that you
04:51:37.680 wanted it to go and would have hit all
04:51:38.958 your take profits or green
04:51:41.080 you guys may get greedy you guys win one
04:51:42.760 trade and you're like man I'm the best
04:51:44.240 at this I'm going to take another one
04:51:46.798 causes you to overtrade or you guys
04:51:50.480 extend your take profit or you just
04:51:52.000 remove your take profit this trade's
04:51:53.520 going up
04:51:55.040 forever no it's not I can promise you it
04:51:58.558 is not going up forever take profits and
04:52:02.040 get the [ __ ] out of the market the next
04:52:03.840 thing that you guys need to do is to
04:52:05.080 control your imp impulses there are
04:52:07.240 three
04:52:08.558 fears that day Traders go go through
04:52:11.000 within the markets the fear of being
04:52:14.600 wrong so fearful of being wrong that's
04:52:18.000 what leads to hesitation and that's what
04:52:19.480 leads to miss opportunities the fear of
04:52:21.520 losing money that also leads to
04:52:23.958 hesitation and that also leads to miss
04:52:25.958 opportunities and last but not least
04:52:28.480 fear of missing
04:52:30.440 out fear of missing out is a huge one
04:52:33.480 especially in day trading let me try and
04:52:35.878 get this [ __ ] through your heads the
04:52:37.718 market has been here for more years than
04:52:40.920 I have been alive and more years than
04:52:42.440 you have been alive and there has been
04:52:43.958 opportunities every single day to catch
04:52:45.878 a trade that could change your life
04:52:47.878 ideally none of these trades change your
04:52:49.440 life because then you're just shooting
04:52:50.480 for the Stars ideally it's just multiple
04:52:52.798 trades that gradually change your life
04:52:54.840 right but every single day for the
04:52:59.280 entire the entirety of your guys' lives
04:53:02.878 has there been an opportunity within the
04:53:05.200 market for you guys to execute and for
04:53:07.080 you guys to make money on every single
04:53:08.718 day there has been opportunity so what
04:53:10.718 makes you think if you miss the trade
04:53:13.440 today if you missed that trade if you
04:53:15.798 missed out on that trade what makes you
04:53:18.160 think that you have to go and try and
04:53:21.040 find another trade today because the
04:53:22.680 Market's just going to disappear
04:53:23.920 tomorrow you're never going to be able
04:53:25.080 to make money ever again [ __ ] no never
04:53:27.520 have the fear of missing out the market
04:53:29.200 will be here forever there's endless
04:53:31.040 amounts of opportunities within this
04:53:32.760 Market there's opportunities today
04:53:35.480 there's opportunities Tomorrow there's
04:53:37.000 going to be opportunities months from
04:53:38.480 now there's going to be opportunities
04:53:40.080 years from now there's going to be
04:53:41.480 opportunities lifetimes from now so you
04:53:43.558 stressing over one single trade that you
04:53:45.798 missed all your oh damn every single
04:53:49.040 step in my strategy or in every single
04:53:50.840 step in tjr strategy got hit but I just
04:53:52.718 didn't take the trade so now I'm going
04:53:53.920 to force myself to look for another
04:53:55.160 trade because ah I just wish I took that
04:53:56.840 trade no shut the [ __ ] up and go home
04:53:59.160 you're done for the day and you better
04:54:01.798 wake up tomorrow morning ready to take
04:54:03.320 that trade why didn't you take that
04:54:04.958 trade in the first place you were
04:54:05.878 fearful you were hesitant why did you
04:54:08.440 hesitate fix that
04:54:11.080 fix these things and you will be a
04:54:13.200 profitable Trader if you guys can handle
04:54:15.360 losses like a pro and handle losses like
04:54:17.400 a lesson you guys will be profitable I
04:54:20.280 can promise you that if you guys can
04:54:21.958 lose money and be unfaced by that
04:54:24.120 knowing that wins are On Your
04:54:26.200 Horizon and knowing that hey as long as
04:54:28.878 I keep good risk management my account
04:54:30.840 it's not going to go down too crazy
04:54:32.600 because I know I'm going to win trades
04:54:34.160 in the future I know that hey this
04:54:36.760 little losing streak that I'm on right
04:54:38.240 now it's not going to last forever and
04:54:39.718 I'm going to keep win be able to accept
04:54:41.840 losses and move the [ __ ] on you got to
04:54:44.040 think in
04:54:45.200 probabilities no profitable day trader
04:54:47.840 is hidden okay 100% win rate it's
04:54:50.558 impossible nobody in the entire world
04:54:52.878 has ever done that besides maybe one
04:54:54.878 person who's taken one trade one and
04:54:57.638 then left forever but if we're talking
04:54:59.600 about people who take trades on a daily
04:55:00.958 basis there's nobody that has 100% win
04:55:02.558 rate you have to be able to see losses
04:55:04.558 as a lesson you have to like encourage
04:55:07.120 losses I like when I'm on a losing
04:55:08.400 streak cuz it exposes my flaws I'm like
04:55:09.958 damn shouldn't have taken a trade here
04:55:11.320 damn shouldn't have done this shouldn't
04:55:12.440 have done that versus when I'm on a
04:55:14.718 winning streak I think I'm invincible
04:55:16.520 and then that's when my emotions get the
04:55:17.878 best of me the next thing that you guys
04:55:19.320 need to do maintain a growth mindset
04:55:22.360 every time that you guys make a mistake
04:55:23.760 every time that you guys make a lesson
04:55:25.320 it's a it's room for growth Journal your
04:55:27.680 trades keep track of your emotions
04:55:30.280 understand why you lost and if you can
04:55:32.280 understand why you lost and you
04:55:33.440 understand the mistake that you made
04:55:34.480 then ideally you never make that mistake
04:55:36.160 again and at the end of the day like I
04:55:39.798 said
04:55:40.760 for day trading is going to be really
04:55:44.120 [ __ ] hard guys I I want to leave you

04:57:00.280 that 97% of people fail at that's the

04:57:26.400 as [ __ ] good but when I watched a
04:57:27.958 video similar to this similar to this it
04:57:29.600 was two hours
04:57:30.878 long and it taught me all the basics

04:59:47.120 felt so weird that was why I felt so
04:59:48.840 [ __ ] self-conscious was because I

05:02:38.120 actually like like got man I [ __ ] I

05:02:45.840 mentor that was willing to do that type
05:02:48.120 of [ __ ] for me and here I am willing to
05:02:51.600 do this [ __ ] for you guys
05:02:54.520 like bro
05:02:56.920 it's I I like I I am the mentor that
05:03:02.958 unprofitable me just like [ __ ] wish
05:03:05.320 he had so [ __ ] bad and I can promise
05:03:09.360 you guys that bro just if you guys can
05:03:12.920 put your faith in me put your trust in
05:03:14.680 me I I am going to take and I'm going to
05:03:17.360 do everything in in my power to help you
05:03:19.200 guys get to get to become a profitable
05:03:21.320 Trader without a doubt in my mind and
05:03:23.718 there's going to be a time where you
05:03:25.200 guys have to let me go as a mentor and
05:03:27.638 there's some people that have been on
05:03:29.440 been on here and followed my journey for
05:03:31.120 long enough I've been on here for like
05:03:32.958 damn near 2 and a half years now bro
05:03:34.878 it's been a while where I've been
05:03:36.520 posting trading videos strategy videos
05:03:39.480 like pschology videos for a while now
05:03:41.600 and uh you know people are like yeah I I
05:03:46.000 no longer need you as a mentor but
05:03:47.558 that's what I'm here for as sad and as
05:03:51.200 as weird as it sounds like you guys are
05:03:53.558 here to use me for what I am I'm a
05:03:57.958 bridge for you guys to cross and there's
05:04:00.798 a [ __ ] rapid ass river that I had to
05:04:03.638 get [ __ ] up by in order to get to the
05:04:05.600 other side but I built a bridge for you
05:04:08.120 guys and my goal as a mentor is to be
05:04:10.958 your guys' Bridge from unprofitable not
05:04:13.760 knowing [ __ ] about day trading to being
05:04:15.558 profitable knowing everything there is
05:04:17.000 to know about day trading and once you
05:04:19.440 guys get over the bridge there's no use
05:04:20.798 for the bridge anymore and I'm
05:04:22.440 completely satisfied with that because I
05:04:24.680 know that if I'm able to help you guys
05:04:28.200 get there and and actually like make
05:04:32.080 your wildest dreams come true that's
05:04:33.920 what makes me happy if I can get you
05:04:36.080 guys to your goals and that that's all
05:04:38.958 that younger me want wanted bro younger
05:04:40.440 me just wanted a mentor that is [ __ ]
05:04:44.000 willing to give him all all the
05:04:46.680 knowledge that he has willing to get on
05:04:49.718 [ __ ] calls with him and [ __ ] willing
05:04:52.958 to like [ __ ] just Co coach him
05:04:56.320 through specific
05:04:58.920 questions
05:05:01.080 and
05:05:03.240 like I I really can't even imagine what
05:05:05.920 my life would be like if I had myself as
05:05:07.798 a mentor back in the day and and I
05:05:10.520 appreciate you guys for being on my team
05:05:14.080 and and watching through this this whole
05:05:16.000 video and uh on that note again I I went
05:05:22.200 through a whole bunch of confluences I
05:05:24.080 went through a whole bunch of [ __ ]
05:05:26.200 within this video not only is it not
05:05:30.600 necessarily enough to like fully turn
05:05:33.920 you profitable in trading I really wish
05:05:36.000 this this this video like was the the
05:05:38.600 the the one and only only piece to get
05:05:40.440 you guys there but like deep down I just
05:05:43.480 know it's not um it it's definitely like
05:05:47.000 in it's an insane amount of information
05:05:50.240 but uh there's there's just so much more
05:05:53.200 info out there and just so many minute
05:05:55.120 details that I just am not able to cover
05:05:57.680 or else this video would literally be
05:05:59.240 like 50 hours long and if you guys want
05:06:03.680 that sort of information that sort of
05:06:05.920 coaching that sort of mentorship where
05:06:07.920 like you guys really do get literally
05:06:11.400 everything like way more in depth on
05:06:14.000 those confluences that I talked about
05:06:16.000 way more in depth on the strategy that I
05:06:18.160 talked to you guys about way more in
05:06:20.400 depth on psychology way more in depth on
05:06:23.160 risk management like literally how to
05:06:24.920 calculate exactly what percentage you
05:06:28.000 should be risking per trade depending on
05:06:31.040 your win rate depending on what your
05:06:33.280 risk reward is like the numbers that I
05:06:35.760 gave you guys are just like estimates
05:06:37.480 right like the goal is just to at least
05:06:40.200 push like just push the masses in the
05:06:42.520 right direction but I can't sculpt you
05:06:45.080 guys as a Trader and what I want to
05:06:47.400 offer to you guys is to be able to
05:06:49.280 actually do that and that's pretty much
05:06:52.718 what my day trading blueprint is and
05:06:55.000 there's a little Link in the description
05:06:56.798 if you guys want to be fully coached by
05:07:00.000 me for like lit like literally get hand
05:07:04.440 [ __ ] sculpted by myself like this
05:07:07.360 video times a thousand because not only
05:07:10.440 are you going to be learning these
05:07:12.000 confluences again but better you're
05:07:13.798 going to be learning more confluences
05:07:15.440 you guys are going to be learning more
05:07:16.680 about the markets you guys are going to
05:07:17.920 be learning like there's there's so much
05:07:19.958 more that I could have expanded on that
05:07:23.320 it like this video would literally just
05:07:24.638 be endless and all of that is within the
05:07:28.080 day trading blueprint and on top of that
05:07:30.400 you guys get on a daily coaching call
05:07:34.558 with me and other coaches where we go
05:07:37.760 over trade reviews so like right now
05:07:40.480 boom you guys take your first freaking
05:07:42.000 trade using this strategy and you're
05:07:43.400 like God damn it I suck what did I do
05:07:45.200 wrong you probably don't know what the
05:07:46.718 [ __ ] you did wrong but if you take it to
05:07:48.920 me or one of my other coaches they're
05:07:50.958 going to be like yeah bro you're a
05:07:52.718 dumbass you mark that fair value Gap
05:07:54.798 incorrectly and you're like ah [ __ ] I
05:07:57.600 forgot those are those are questions
05:07:59.760 that I wish I had answered for myself
05:08:02.878 that would have bridge the gap for me so
05:08:04.480 much quicker that instead of having to
05:08:06.360 sift through YouTube video YouTube video
05:08:08.320 YouTube video YouTube video and being
05:08:10.160 like oh [ __ ] I did this wrong oh [ __ ]
05:08:11.760 I'm doing this wrong and just keeping
05:08:13.520 everything in check like if I could get
05:08:14.760 on a coaching call every single day with
05:08:17.240 profitable Traders I mean like such as
05:08:19.600 myself oh my God like the the speedrun
05:08:22.878 to profitability is [ __ ] insane like
05:08:26.520 there are literally people that go from
05:08:28.760 knowing nothing about trading who go
05:08:31.280 through this program and get
05:08:34.718 funded and turn into a profitable Trader
05:08:37.718 literally two months later I'm not even
05:08:40.040 joking pop literally pop up the
05:08:41.840 testimonial of somebody who didn't know
05:08:43.600 [ __ ] and then 2 months later they're
05:08:45.480 they're a profitable Trader passing a
05:08:47.040 funded account so I'm I like look I gave
05:08:50.600 you a a whole bunch of information here
05:08:53.320 by all means I'm not telling you guys
05:08:54.920 that you guys need to go out of your way
05:08:56.400 and buy my [ __ ] coaching but I but I
05:08:59.280 am saying that you guys will get
05:09:01.840 infinitely farther after watching this
05:09:04.920 video and then coming into my coaching
05:09:07.760 then if you guys just watch this video
05:09:09.760 and then try and grind grind grind and
05:09:11.480 do it on your own because we as coaches
05:09:15.878 myself I know ex the exact position that
05:09:19.558 you were in and all these other
05:09:21.240 profitable traders that are in there
05:09:22.760 with me to help teach you and sculpt you
05:09:24.920 as a Trader know the exact position that
05:09:27.200 you are in know the exact mistakes that
05:09:29.280 you guys are probably making so when you
05:09:31.120 guys come to us and you're like hey I
05:09:32.760 have a question we're literally just
05:09:34.040 like stop bro I know what you're going
05:09:35.760 to say you're wrong don't do this do
05:09:38.520 that move on with your day and you're
05:09:40.320 like wa thank the Lord and it's just
05:09:43.280 like it it it just brings so much mental
05:09:46.000 Clarity to trading where before like for
05:09:49.360 me I would just I would just get in
05:09:52.000 there and it's like okay well that like
05:09:56.040 [ __ ] I lost the trade and I don't know
05:09:57.958 [ __ ] why I think I marked all my
05:09:59.920 confluences out correctly I think I took
05:10:02.000 the right trade I just don't know why I
05:10:04.120 lost is this a day that I should have
05:10:05.958 just scrapped up to the market being bad
05:10:08.120 or did I actually do something wrong I
05:10:09.638 didn't have those questions to get
05:10:10.760 answered but you guys have that
05:10:12.878 opportunity to get questions answered
05:10:14.840 you guys can literally send us a picture
05:10:17.040 of your trade and be like what did I do
05:10:18.920 wrong here did I mark this Confluence
05:10:20.840 out
05:10:21.718 incorrectly was I supposed to trade at
05:10:23.878 this time what did I do incorrectly and
05:10:26.120 that it's like boom this this this this
05:10:28.878 was great this was good don't do this
05:10:31.200 again dumbass why the [ __ ] would you
05:10:33.160 take this and then boom patch patch
05:10:36.240 patch patch and you're over that over
05:10:38.920 all of those mistakes that you probably
05:10:40.840 wouldn't have even known were mistakes
05:10:43.040 from the jump if if you if you didn't
05:10:45.160 have us there so again by all means
05:10:48.320 there's a at the end of the day there's
05:10:50.600 there's literally all free education
05:10:53.920 everywhere across the entire internet
05:10:55.958 right we we know that like at the end of
05:10:58.558 the day the internet has literally every
05:11:00.480 piece of information known to man right
05:11:03.200 so yeah you could say I I just want to
05:11:06.000 you know learn day trading on my own and
05:11:08.558 and just go through these videos that
05:11:10.200 like that's fine by me that's how I did
05:11:12.120 it it was [ __ ] The Trenches it took
05:11:14.000 me 2 years to do it but I do think that
05:11:17.400 I can be a huge [ __ ] service to you
05:11:20.160 and your profitable Journey as a day
05:11:21.840 trader and also just me understanding
05:11:24.040 who you are as a person and
05:11:26.280 understanding where you're at as a
05:11:27.320 Trader and also all these other
05:11:28.600 profitable traders who are actually even
05:11:30.240 more similar to you than I am to you
05:11:32.680 because you guys probably see me as like
05:11:34.638 oh this guy's this guy's Rich he's got
05:11:37.040 all the money in the world he doesn't
05:11:38.200 even know what it's like to be in my my
05:11:39.400 position anymore it's like no I do but
05:11:41.638 there are people that have been
05:11:43.320 profitable for like just one year now
05:11:45.280 and and have just got out of that exact
05:11:47.718 same position that you guys are in right
05:11:50.400 the [ __ ] now and they're in there to
05:11:52.600 help you as well so if you guys want
05:11:56.240 that and also also this the sad thing is
05:11:59.440 the spots are super limited so like I'm
05:12:01.638 assuming there's going to be a whole
05:12:02.840 bunch of people like trying to get in it
05:12:05.280 after this video which like by all means
05:12:07.638 is great but there's only certain types
05:12:09.760 of people that I want to let in clearly
05:12:11.638 off this video I don't want to let you
05:12:12.958 in if you're going to be lazy and if
05:12:14.638 you're not willing to put in the work
05:12:15.878 you have to be delusional you have to be
05:12:17.400 [ __ ] crazy about this [ __ ] you have
05:12:19.160 to be really willing to get like really
05:12:22.080 [ __ ] willing to be a professional day
05:12:24.200 trader like I want to ideally see a mini
05:12:28.440 version of me within that interview and
05:12:30.600 within that application and if I can't
05:12:32.600 see that mini version of me within that
05:12:35.200 application then just straight up like
05:12:36.878 you guys aren't going to get let in and
05:12:39.320 I know that sounds rude and that sounds
05:12:41.400 mean but if if you aren't the Mini
05:12:44.480 version of me then by all means just
05:12:46.680 like whatever take advantage of my
05:12:48.000 YouTube videos
05:12:49.480 but I'm telling you that I I don't waste
05:12:51.920 my time on people that I don't see
05:12:53.920 potential in and I hope that I can see
05:12:57.000 potential in every single one of you
05:12:58.600 guys but you guys have to prove that to
05:13:00.200 me that that that's like the very first
05:13:02.160 thing it's like I'm not just going to
05:13:03.638 let in any and everybody that just says
05:13:05.718 like yeah just make make me Rich right
05:13:07.600 now I don't even care about this trading
05:13:08.798 thing I just want to like no bro you're
05:13:10.200 not going to get let in if I can see
05:13:11.760 that you guys are truly passionate about
05:13:13.200 this [ __ ] and it and it and if it's
05:13:15.120 actually worth my time to be coaching
