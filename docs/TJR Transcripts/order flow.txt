00:00:00.520 ladies and gentlemen boys and girls welcome to a long awaited orderflow
00:00:07.640 explained video now everybody has been spamming me in the comments to make this
00:00:13.200 video so if this video doesn't get a million views I don't know what I'm going to do I might just have to come to
00:00:20.240 your house and touch you inappropriately so with that being said
00:00:25.680 hopefully I have some workers at the crib right now that are like drilling holes in my walls and [ __ ] um just to
00:00:32.320 like try and look at me through a peole so hopefully they're not making too much noise but with that being said let's uh
00:00:40.480 let's jump right into this let's get into the charts and just break down what orderflow even is how we can use it how
00:00:47.079 I use it to identify daily bias and on top of that how you guys can
00:00:54.079 use it to win [ __ ] trades so first thing that we want to do is understand
00:00:59.320 what is order flow so I talk about this all the time and honestly it's literally just a fancy ass word that people like
00:01:05.438 me like to use to make you guys confused and think that you need to see another video um but it's literally just
00:01:14.360 Trends but don't get off the video because I'm going to explain this a lot better and way more in detail than just
00:01:21.680 it's an uptrend or it's a downtrend um there's a lot of different things like
00:01:26.960 disrespecting bullish order flow or respecting bullish order flow flow or having a potential change in order flow
00:01:33.040 and all of these things that we're going to show on the charts but essentially order flow is just what trend we are in
00:01:40.600 are we in an uptrend or are we in a downtrend okay so how do we identify
00:01:49.840 it how do we identify bullish order Flow by literally just looking at the most recent break of structure like that that
00:01:56.119 to me is is super easy just look at most recent break of structure or just look
00:02:02.399 at I was about to say order flow or just look at the most recent highs and lows that were made or most
00:02:09.669 [Music] recent or the most recent highs and lows because as we know this is the first
00:02:15.560 step of order flow bullish order flow or uptrends move in higher highs and higher
00:02:22.519 lows yay we're literally teaching kindergartener subjects here kindergarten [ __ ] and y'all are asking
00:02:28.840 for a YouTube video on it ridiculous man anyways bearish order
00:02:35.000 flow is what lower lows and lower highs and with that being said if you
00:02:42.200 guys want to learn more about this go ahead and click the link in the bio to get the day trading blueprint where I
00:02:47.640 teach you guys stuff like this for $1 billion by my course please and thank
00:02:54.080 you guys subscribe I'll catch you guys in the next one peace I'm just kidding um but but this is the start of it okay
00:03:03.200 so downtrends move in lower lows and lower highs uptrends move in higher
00:03:08.319 highs and higher lows so in order to identify bullish order flow or bearish order flow we just look at the most recent highs and lows okay we see boom
00:03:15.040 we're making higher highs and higher lows what are we in bullish order flow if we're making lower highs and lower lows what are we in bearish order flow
00:03:21.680 now is when we get into the advanced [ __ ] like how do we identify disrespect
00:03:28.439 disrespecting bullet order flow or disrespecting bearish order flow and there's three main confluences that I
00:03:35.560 use um to identify these so let's talk about the confluences to identify
00:03:41.599 disrespecting order flow
00:03:48.400 disrespecting order flow I use break of structure I use inverse for Value gaps
00:03:54.879 and the 79% extension on the FIB okay
00:04:01.319 so as we know again absolutely kindergartener subjects well no some of you guys are
00:04:08.560 kindergarteners in that case I will not come over to your house and touch you that is I'm already banned from doing
00:04:14.799 that I'm kidding that was such a bad joke [ __ ] I don't even have an editor editor editor this so we're just going
00:04:21.918 to have to leave that one in that was not a good joke bro I'm sorry don't don't clip that or any
00:04:29.759 anything skip to the next one Indians don't shower and they wkak okay boom that's a perfect one use that one you're
00:04:36.320 welcome Clippers okay so first one break of structure how do we identify break of structure within an uptrend we find the
00:04:43.080 most recent low that was made and we need a candle closure underneath it okay if you guys want to learn how to
00:04:50.479 identify break of structure better I have literally a quadrillion videos on it in my boot camp in my tradeing
00:04:57.199 transformation okay go watch those to identify break of structure but essentially we see price come down we
00:05:04.240 close underneath the most recent low boom that is one form of disrespecting
00:05:10.240 bullish order flow why because we're literally closing underneath the underneath the uptrend okay the next way
00:05:17.680 that we can disrespect order flow is if we have a bullish fair value Gap right here and we close underneath it causing
00:05:24.000 an inverse fair value Gap okay and if you guys don't know what an inverse fair value Gap is I'm going to show you guys
00:05:30.600 some examples on the chart I'm also going to show you guys examples of break of structure on the chart I'm also going to show you guys examples of the 79% FIB
00:05:37.560 extension but I have videos on both of these in the uh the boot camp and the
00:05:44.039 day trading transformation okay so if we get an inverse for Value Gap
00:05:50.680 within an uptrend disrespecting a bullish fair value Gap what are we doing we're disrespecting bullish order flow
00:05:57.160 why because if we were to respect bullish order flow we would come into that fair value Gap and then we would just move up off of it but when we don't
00:06:03.479 do that what are we doing we're disrespecting bullish order flow now last but not least we have the 79%
00:06:08.639 extension of on the Fibonacci so all we do is we draw it out just like we were to draw out equilibrium we see we have
00:06:15.680 the 79% extension right here if price comes down and moves past the 79%
00:06:21.520 extension to me that's disrespecting bullish order flow and we are eventually going to come down and break structure
00:06:28.199 or inverse of fair value Gap if there's anything underneath here okay I rarely use this one I just recently taught this
00:06:35.120 to the blueprint students um because I used it in one of my trade Recaps and
00:06:40.360 they were all freaking out about it honestly you guys can like very well do
00:06:45.840 without this [ __ ] um I just wanted to add this in here because I Ed it in one of my trade Recaps and everybody was
00:06:51.759 freaking out about it okay so those are the three ways that we can disrespect orderflow now same thing in a Trend how
00:07:00.400 do we disrespect bearish order flow we get what a break of structure to the upside how do we identify a break of
00:07:06.759 structure to the upside we see a closure above the most recent high that was made within the downtrend we get an inverse
00:07:13.759 fair value Gap how do we see that we look for a bearish fair value Gap that
00:07:18.960 gets closed above by a Candlestick in turn that disrespects bearish order flow
00:07:24.280 and last but not least we take it from the high down to the low and then
00:07:32.360 if price pushes past the 79% extension it's pretty safe to assume that bearish
00:07:37.599 order flow has been disrespected cool cool so now how do we
00:07:44.280 show that order flow is being respected because not only do we know need to know how to identify bullish and bearish
00:07:51.120 Order flow we also need to know how it gets disrespected and then also how does it get respected and we're going to put all of
00:07:57.479 this together onto the charts so that you guys can become profitable Traders but first hold
00:08:03.879 on I'm getting thirsty let me hit a chug
00:08:24.210 [Music] jug oh
00:08:30.360 oh oh yeah God damn it man that bottle's never
00:08:36.640 getting picked up for like the next 5 years swear to God that shit's way behind my desk I'm never picking that [ __ ] up okay how do we respect bullish
00:08:44.880 wow I'm wide awake now shout out Santa Cruz medicinals just kidding I didn't use any of his
00:08:50.839 electrolytes wow we're geeking today jez man okay how do we respect bullish
00:08:56.040 orderflow let me try and remember hold on I got to watch a YouTube video on
00:09:02.480 this really
00:09:10.079 quick hold
00:09:17.640 on hold on let me find this video just so I can remind myself really quick
00:09:34.040 yo ever heard of jerkmate this is fun entertaining and addictive as the most popular social network with
00:09:42.800 hey okay now that we know how to how we how to respect orderflow I'm going to
00:09:49.640 put this together okay so how do we respect orderflow with fair value gaps with order blocks with breaker blocks
00:09:56.880 with equilibrium what else that's pretty much it or like OT but we
00:10:04.160 don't we don't need to do that [ __ ] this is all you need so how do we respect order flow when we're in an uptrend what
00:10:11.000 are we doing we're respecting order flow we're either hitting equilibrium filling fair value gaps filling order blocks and
00:10:17.440 breaker blocks all that [ __ ] so how is this useful now that we know
00:10:25.120 how to and again if you guys don't know what a fair value Gap is an order block is the breaker block is equilibrium go
00:10:30.880 watch my boot camp I cover all of that and also if you just want to learn from me directly and genuinely like be my
00:10:36.760 student get coached by me for like two months straight there's a link in the description you guys can become a blueprint student we literally pass we
00:10:44.360 have like I can show you guys right now on my Discord bro we pass around like we average three to four funded accounts
00:10:50.639 pass per day from students which is just like [ __ ] berserk I literally dare any other mentor to have that much
00:10:57.079 success with their students like ever bro it's I like I've never seen that [ __ ] before and I've been in the trading
00:11:03.480 space for a minute um but anyways if you want to know how to
00:11:11.360 identify fair value GI order blocks breaker blocks equilibrium okay watch boot camp watch trading transformation
00:11:16.920 and if you want to learn from me directly there's going to be a link in the description to join the blueprint
00:11:21.959 But continuing on this now that we know what orderflow is
00:11:27.240 how to identify it how it can get disrespected and how it can be respected how do we apply this to the actual
00:11:36.920 charts price action recently has been like actually poopy diaper
00:11:47.959 but let's just bring up a random ass Market open yo welcome to jerk
00:11:56.279 mate yo who invented that horny ass
00:12:01.360 commercial bro yeah let me try and find a good Market
00:12:11.079 open yeah I've been watching that [ __ ] way
00:12:17.199 too much literally my favorite show at this point welcome to Jeremy I'm going to
00:12:25.760 catch you yeah welcome Jer me okay this is
00:12:32.120 fine Prime Time whine and [ __ ] dine let me delete this actually delete the
00:12:38.000 macro okay so
00:12:44.040 orderflow when I'm looking for entries how am I going to use this I'm mainly looking at the F minute time frame five
00:12:50.399 minute orderflow for the most part dictates like everything for me in terms of where
00:12:58.560 I'm looking to trade in terms of where I'm entering and then I scale down to the 1 minute time frame to look for a
00:13:04.160 tra like look for an entry so this isn't my whole strategy but just to keep this
00:13:09.560 like super dead simple just on orderflow what can we see Market opens
00:13:15.000 right here okay cool we're in bearish order flow right now because we broke 5 minute structure to the downside right
00:13:21.440 here on this Candlestick cool but that's like 5 minutes into Market open we obviously want to wait for Market to
00:13:27.800 move into the macro move into to an optimal time to trade when this happens at around 950
00:13:34.800 right here we're not really looking to take shorts because it's like okay we're
00:13:40.120 we're kind of moving up here okay and there's obviously a bunch of other reasons why we wouldn't want to be looking for shorts we're filling in a
00:13:46.519 high time frame imbalance right here okay and that that's high time frame orderflow and we'll get into that a
00:13:52.199 little bit later but we see boom 5 minute break of structure at the
00:13:57.320 downside right here but then following that what do we get we get a 5-minute break of structure to the
00:14:02.440 upside so what did we just do we formed 5 minute bullish order
00:14:09.000 flow okay and we disrespected 5 minute bearish order flow
00:14:14.440 why because we just broke structure to the upside so what is that doing the previous bearish order flow that we were in we just disrespected it and now in
00:14:22.639 order for me to like 1 million per confirm that we are in bullish order
00:14:27.759 flow and news flag this is literally how I take trades I look for the previous
00:14:33.160 order flow to get disrespected then I look for New Order flow to get
00:14:38.360 respected so previous bearish order flow gets disrespected with a breaking structure of the upside then following
00:14:44.000 that what are we looking for we're looking for New Order flow to get respected so what do we have we have a fair value Gap here we have we can
00:14:51.160 literally draw out every single one we have equilibrium that gets hit we have a
00:14:56.839 breaker block right here that gets hit we have the order block right here that
00:15:02.399 gets hit literally every single one of our confluences ends up getting hit fair value Gap equilibrium breaker block order block all of that [ __ ] gets hit
00:15:10.600 and then from there what am I doing I'm scaling down to the 1 minute time frame if it even lets me move over
00:15:17.959 here and then all I'm doing is I'm looking for one minute order flow
00:15:23.399 because on a 5-minute retrace again everybody wanted me to make a video on the 5-minute retrace it's orderflow
00:15:29.880 5 minute retrace okay we wait for the 5 minute retrace 5 minute retrace typically makes the one minute order
00:15:36.440 flow turn into the other direction okay so if we're look if we're if we
00:15:42.000 disrespect bearish order flow to the upside and then we're looking to get bullish order flow respected to the
00:15:47.519 upside on the one minute time frame we're typic typically going to break structure or inverse a gap whatever
00:15:54.440 we're typically going to have bearish order flow on the one minute time frame when we're looking to respect bullish
00:16:02.079 order flow on the 5 minute time frame if not it doesn't really matter and we can take the trade regardless but typically
00:16:07.480 we get a one minute reversal and then all that we're looking for is just boom Another reversal and with this I'm I'm
00:16:15.839 typically not never really looking um
00:16:21.000 once we get the break of structure to the upside or an inverse for Value Gap to the upside on the 1 minute time frame
00:16:26.880 I'm not looking for order flow to get respected on the 1 minute time frame because if the 1 minute time frame is flipping into bullish order flow or
00:16:33.440 disrespecting bearish order flow and the 5 minute is already in bullish order flow and we're getting one
00:16:39.959 minute break of structure to the upside off of a one off of a 5 minute
00:16:47.399 Confluence that's already bullish that's showing us that like we're respecting 5 minute order flow and five minute
00:16:54.839 confluences then I'm okay taking that trade without needing to wait for a 1 minute fair value Gap or a 1 minute
00:17:01.000 equilibrium I mean you can see that it it would have worked right we have a fair value Gap right here and then boom it ends up getting filled we would have
00:17:07.079 been able to take this trade but me personally I don't I don't have to wait for it and then boom take profits hit
00:17:12.400 whatever Target previous draws on liquidity Target Fair Value gaps whatever boom like that's all it is Bros
00:17:20.039 like straight up Bros that is literally all it is now how can we use this on the high
00:17:26.559 time frames to help us so all I'm going to say all I'm going to
00:17:34.000 say I made a daily bias video last year and everybody was making
00:17:40.400 fun of me for it saying tjr tjr is such a beginner teacher tjr um tjr is so
00:17:47.919 beginner okay he doesn't he doesn't teach you everything that you need to learn um you know don't watch or watch
00:17:54.280 watch his boot camp and that's it I made that daily bias video saying
00:17:59.520 you want to look at the high time frame Trends and identify what point in time we are in the high time frame Trend
00:18:05.679 whether we're going to sweep out liquidity or whether we're going to fill in imbalance to continue the trend everybody was making fun of me for that
00:18:11.960 video saying this is so beginner you need to use this this this this this this this fast forward one year
00:18:18.520 later here we are and every single person is finding their daily bias using
00:18:24.840 this [ __ ] called internal and external liquidity which news flash Buckaroo is literally
00:18:33.000 just orderflow and news flash orderflow is literally just uptrends and [ __ ]
00:18:41.240 downtrends you got played bro you got played as like as [ __ ]
00:18:47.679 bro but anyways I'm I'm going to make this daily buys video again in this
00:18:53.919 video and maybe you guys will [ __ ] listen now
00:18:59.000 so just like on the lower time frames when we're identifying order flow bullish order
00:19:06.360 flow and bearish Order flow disrespects all of that high time frames how do they
00:19:11.520 move they move in Trends they move in higher highs and higher lows lower highs and lower lows cool our job when trying
00:19:19.000 to identify our daily bias is to be able to identify what point in time are we in
00:19:27.480 in these high time frame trends Trends are
00:19:32.720 we sweeping out like hourly liquidity or lower time frame liquidity to go down to
00:19:38.360 fill a 4our imbalance to move higher or are we in a
00:19:46.720 4H hour imbalance to sweep out lower time frame liquidity to move higher
00:19:53.000 okay on the higher time frames your goal is literally just to identify the point
00:19:58.960 in order flow that we are in so on the 4-Hour time frame right now we were
00:20:04.080 actually in consolidation so there's three types of orderflow uptrend downtrend
00:20:09.159 consolidation but we just broke out of this but I already know this because I
00:20:14.480 mean I told blueprint students I wanted this [ __ ] to be filled told them that [ __ ] literally
00:20:20.080 yesterday hey man I'm good I'm good at this [ __ ] but anyways on The Daily time frame what are
00:20:27.440 we in we're in an uptrend okay I know this [ __ ] looks like actual like throw
00:20:32.559 up on the chart but we're in an uptrend how do I know that because I I'm literally just looking at the order flow
00:20:38.720 I know it's hard to identify right now but high low higher high soon to make a higher low or we just dump but for the
00:20:46.159 time being we're in an uptrend so what point of order flow are we in right now
00:20:51.600 before today we were at the high now we're
00:20:57.200 going down to make what the higher low in what well we have to respect the
00:21:03.200 bullish order flow so what confluences do we have Dandy do we have a fair value
00:21:08.760 Gap we have equilibrium you could probably find like
00:21:15.279 some sort of 4our order block 4H hour breaker block whatever oh yeah we do boom four hour 4our order block
00:21:22.120 literally right at equilibrium we have the breaker right
00:21:27.159 here pretty much same same area as the order block
00:21:32.840 boom so prior to this what we were what were we assuming that price was going to
00:21:38.279 do come down because we've already made the extension in an
00:21:45.240 uptrend we've already made the move up so what comes
00:21:52.039 next the higher low and then once we made the higher low what comes next the
00:21:59.120 extension it's crazy that I had to make this video to remind you guys of the absolute beginner Concepts that you guys
00:22:07.400 seem to have just Lost in Translation through all of these nitty-gritty [ __ ] that you guys have been
00:22:13.640 studying for the past year it's time for you guys to come back to Daddy and it's time for me to actually put [ __ ] on game
00:22:19.919 okay because I've been trying to teach you guys the right way in the simple way but you guys didn't want to [ __ ] listen and now here you are trading the
00:22:27.760 simple way because you realize the way that I trade actually [ __ ] works and now I'm not saying that that
00:22:34.039 the way that other people trade doesn't work I'm not saying that at all like everybody has their own strategy but I'm
00:22:40.080 just saying you guys are getting lost in [ __ ] translation with all this YouTube [ __ ] cut the crap stick to
00:22:46.279 what [ __ ] works stick to the simple [ __ ] y'all are y'all y'all are like your
00:22:51.679 guys' charts looks like [ __ ] baloney right now bro you guys have [ __ ] written like this on a trend line that's going
00:22:58.240 up down and sideways y'all have some [ __ ] like that looks like this on your
00:23:04.640 chart and you label it like this and you're and then you make fun of a video
00:23:10.120 of me who's literally a profitable Trader who shows every single trade that I take on a daily [ __ ] basis and how
00:23:15.880 much I make and how much I lose and and y'all are just like well
00:23:22.039 you didn't account for the low [ __ ] like buddy you are trading on a funded
00:23:29.960 account and you can't even pass it I am trading on a live account worth
00:23:36.039 literally your father's net worth probably more like who are we like what are we
00:23:43.799 doing right now you're telling me I didn't account for whatever you put on the chart maybe the [ __ ] that you put on
00:23:49.159 the chart it's what's making you lose bro
00:23:55.919 anyways higher time frames what are we looking for we're just looking for at what point in time we are
00:24:02.320 at in the order flow do we need to extend to the upside to take out
00:24:08.360 external liquidity or do we need to make a higher low and seek out internal
00:24:18.720 liquidity that's how you guys look because I literally put you guys on this exact game a year ago and y'all didn't
00:24:26.840 want to appreciate it I hope you appreciate it this time cuz this is the last [ __ ] time that I'm making this
00:24:32.200 damn video higher Time Flame higher time frame order flow how do we how do we
00:24:38.679 identify our [ __ ] daily bias by literally just looking at what point in time we are in the high time high time
00:24:45.799 frame order flow so with this right we saw okay boom
00:24:52.880 literally like if we just come on manate if we just like use
00:24:59.080 the draw tool remember when I taught you guys how to use the draw tool you guys have moved so far from this [ __ ] it
00:25:04.200 pisses me off actually it pisses me off how far how far you guys have strayed from simple
00:25:11.120 [ __ ] simple [ __ ] gets you paid bro I'm telling
00:25:16.200 you if you guys just draw this [ __ ]
00:25:21.720 out or we went sideways for a bit boom
00:25:26.919 boom boom what's
00:25:34.559 next all right and I can look in uptrend sorry
00:25:43.640 there there they go in uptrends again it seems like you guys
00:25:49.880 need a reminder we make a high we make a low we have to what push past this High
00:25:56.080 to continue the uptrend and then then what after we push past that high what are we going to come down and do we're
00:26:01.840 going to fill some sort of fair value Gap some sort of equilibrium some sort of breaker block some sort of order block once we fill it what are we going
00:26:07.080 to do we're going to push past this high again so now what can we use these highs as take [ __ ] profits boom simple
00:26:13.120 [ __ ] [ __ ] bro it's simple simple simple [ __ ] let me show you guys an example of
00:26:19.840 this on the high time frame and then we'll get the [ __ ] out of here ready
00:26:28.559 this is a perfect example okay liquidity sweep then what boom break structure and oh my God it's so good prior God man I
00:26:37.279 swear to God if you guys can you guys just please listen to Daddy for like the one time for the one time please
00:26:43.520 bro listen to me look okay we break bearish order flow
00:26:50.039 right here we disrespect bearish order flow okay cool we get to break structure to the upside okay cool what are we in
00:26:56.960 now bullet sh flow awesome what do we come down come down to do boom We respect bullish order Flow by filling in
00:27:02.320 this fair value Gap awesome okay from there we move up we
00:27:07.360 move up every time we have a low we have a
00:27:13.000 high we have a higher low what do we do with the following High we push past it once we push pass it what are we going
00:27:19.480 to do we're going to make a higher low boom we make a higher low how do we need to change
00:27:26.720 directions what do we need to do in order to change directions in order to change order flow liquidity
00:27:32.840 sweep so we still end up pushing past this High time frame high but what is it
00:27:38.000 to do now to sweep out liquidity so regardless if we see this price move
00:27:43.039 down and let's say that there even though there this wasn't New York Stock Exchange open but let's say that we were
00:27:48.919 we had an open right here what would we still be in we' still be in bullish OD flow what are we in a fair value Gap
00:27:55.039 what are we looking to do respect this fair value Gap we look for Longs up to
00:28:00.080 what boom these highs why because we're in bullish order flow in regardless of if we're going to change directions
00:28:08.360 here we still take out these highs and we still hit take profit following
00:28:16.159 that we break 4 Hour order flow to the downside
00:28:22.519 cool boom we get a move up then once we make that move up once we fill in this
00:28:28.519 fair value Gap right here which we just did and we see entries where are we targeting the low why because we're in
00:28:35.279 bar shorter flow oh my God and then what does the low [ __ ] do it floods the [ __ ] face to the
00:28:42.000 downside pissed me off that you guys didn't listen to me a year ago it really does because I'm making the same exact
00:28:47.200 [ __ ] video same situation on NASDAQ here okay
00:28:54.440 what are we doing right now we're filling in high time frame waterlow we're filling in we're respecting High time frame order flow we're filling this
00:29:00.279 for Value Gap what are we likely going to do in the next coming
00:29:06.039 days take out this high once we take out that high what are we probably going to do there's probably going to be fair
00:29:11.519 value gaps made there's probably order blocks whatever different confluences for us to come down and then when we're
00:29:17.039 in those what do we do when we're in those internal and external draw
00:29:22.919 liquidities okay all that we're doing is we're going down to the 5minute time frame and
