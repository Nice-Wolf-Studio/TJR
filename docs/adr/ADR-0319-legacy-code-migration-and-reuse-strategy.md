## Context

This is the **third iteration** of building the TJR Suite. Previous attempts exist in the following repositories:

1. **TJR** (https://github.com/Nice-Wolf-Studio/TJR) - Most recent, contains substantial trading analysis code
2. **GladOSv2** (https://github.com/Nice-Wolf-Studio/GladOSv2) - Private/deleted, inaccessible
3. **TJR-Tools** (https://github.com/Nice-Wolf-Studio/TJR-Tools) - Private/deleted, inaccessible
4. **github-pull-request** (https://github.com/Nice-Wolf-Studio/github-pull-request) - Automation tool, not trading-related

### Analysis of TJR Repository (Previous Iteration)

The TJR repository contains a TypeScript monorepo with **significant existing trading analysis capabilities** that can be migrated to the current tjr-suite codebase.

#### **Existing Capabilities in TJR Repository**

**1. @tjr/analysis-kit Package**
- ✅ **`detectSwings()`** - Swing high/low detection using lookback window
- ✅ **`calculateDailyBias()`** - Daily bias calculation (bullish/bearish/neutral) with confidence scores
- ✅ **`extractSessionExtremes()`** - Session-based OHLC extraction (Asia/London/NY)
- ✅ **`classifyDayProfile()`** - Day profile classification (Trend/Range/Distribution)

**2. @tjr/tjr-tools Package**
- ✅ **`detectFVGs()`** - Fair Value Gap detection (3-candlestick pattern)
- ✅ **`detectOrderBlocks()`** - Order Block detection
- ✅ **`analyze()`** - Main confluence detection function

**3. Infrastructure Packages**
- ✅ **symbol-registry** - Trading instrument/symbol metadata management
- ✅ **sessions-calendar** - Trading session time tracking
- ✅ **bars-cache** - Multi-tier historical bar caching (SQLite/Postgres)
- ✅ **market-data-core** - Core market data infrastructure
- ✅ **provider-databento, provider-polygon, provider-yahoo** - Market data integrations
- ✅ **discord-bot-core** - Discord bot integration
- ✅ **db-simple** - Lightweight database utility
- ✅ **logger** - Structured logging with PII redaction

**4. Dev Tools**
- ✅ CLI tools for backtesting and data replay (mentioned in README)

#### **Code Quality & Architecture**

**Positive Characteristics:**
- Pure, deterministic functions with zero I/O (analysis-kit)
- Strict TypeScript types with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- pnpm workspace monorepo structure
- Comprehensive ESLint/Prettier configuration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Changesets for semantic versioning
- Uses Node.js test runner

**Alignment with Wolf Ethos:**
- ✅ Pure functions = reversible, testable
- ✅ Type safety = evidence-first validation
- ✅ Modular packages = smallest viable changes
- ✅ Structured logging = operability as a feature

## Decision

We will **selectively migrate and refactor code** from the TJR repository into the current tjr-suite codebase, prioritizing high-quality, well-tested components while avoiding wholesale copy-paste that could introduce technical debt.

### Migration Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Components (Immediate Migration)**

Migrate core market structure analysis from TJR repository to accelerate Phase 1 of ADR-0318.

**Components to Migrate:**

1. **@tjr/analysis-kit → Current @tjr/analysis-kit**
   - `detectSwings()` function (with tests and fixtures)
   - `extractSessionExtremes()` function
   - `classifyDayProfile()` function
   - Associated TypeScript types (Bar, SwingPoint, SwingType, etc.)

   **Migration Steps:**
   - Copy source files from TJR repo `packages/analysis-kit/src/`
   - Copy test files and fixtures
   - Validate against TJR transcripts (09/30/2025 trade)
   - Update imports to align with current monorepo structure

2. **@tjr/tjr-tools → New @tjr/pattern-recognition**
   - `detectFVGs()` function (Fair Value Gap detection)
   - `detectOrderBlocks()` function
   - `analyze()` confluence detection function

   **Migration Steps:**
   - Rename package to `@tjr/pattern-recognition` for clarity
   - Copy source files from TJR repo `packages/tjr-tools/src/`
   - Copy tests and fixtures
   - Validate FVG detection against TJR transcript examples
   - Document any gaps vs. TJR's methodology (e.g., Inverse FVG detection)

3. **Infrastructure Packages (Selective Migration)**
   - **sessions-calendar** → Integrate into current @tjr/market-data-core or create new package
   - **bars-cache** → Already exists in current repo, compare implementations and merge improvements
   - **logger** → Already exists in current repo (@tjr/logger), keep current implementation
   - **db-simple** → Already exists, keep current implementation

   **Migration Approach:**
   - Compare current vs. legacy implementations
   - Keep current implementation if feature-equivalent
   - Cherry-pick specific improvements (e.g., better session detection logic)

**Deliverables:**
- `packages/analysis-kit/` with swing detection, bias calculation, session extraction
- `packages/pattern-recognition/` with FVG and order block detection
- Updated unit tests and fixtures
- Documentation of migrated functions

**Validation:**
- All migrated functions pass existing tests from TJR repo
- Swing detection matches TJR's 09/30/2025 transcript analysis
- FVG detection identifies same gaps as TJR's commentary

#### **Phase 2: Pattern Recognition Components (Post-Foundation)**

Extend pattern recognition capabilities after validating Phase 1 migration.

**Components to Develop (Not Migrate):**

These were mentioned in TJR repo README but **not found in code search**, so we'll build them new in current repo:

1. **Inverse FVG Detection** - Build from scratch using TJR transcripts
2. **Liquidity Sweep Detection** - Build from scratch
3. **Relative Equal Highs/Lows** - Build from scratch
4. **Key Level Tracker** - Build from scratch with persistent storage

**Deliverables:**
- Complete `@tjr/pattern-recognition` package
- Integration tests against TJR transcripts
- Documentation aligned with TJR's methodology

#### **Phase 3: Multi-Symbol Analysis (New Development)**

No prior implementation found in TJR repository. Build from scratch per ADR-0318 Phase 3.

**Components:**
- SMT divergence detector (ES vs NQ)
- Leading/lagging index identifier
- Symbol synchronization tracker
- Correlation calculator

#### **Phase 4: Daily Bias Engine (Hybrid Approach)**

TJR repo has `calculateDailyBias()` but it's unclear how comprehensive it is.

**Strategy:**
1. Migrate `calculateDailyBias()` from TJR repo
2. Evaluate against TJR's transcript bias decisions
3. Extend with missing components:
   - Trend phase classifier (extension vs retrace)
   - Confluence scoring system
   - Target level generator
   - Risk/reward calculator

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced `@tjr/bias-engine` package
- Validation against multiple transcript sessions
- Confluence weighting documentation

#### **Phase 5: Execution Logic (New Development)**

No prior implementation found. Build from scratch per ADR-0318 Phase 5.

#### **Phase 6: Backtesting (Partial Migration)**

TJR repo mentions "CLI tools for backtesting" but specifics not accessible via GitHub web.

**Strategy:**
1. Check if backtesting CLI tools exist in local clone of TJR repo
2. If found, evaluate for migration
3. If not found or inadequate, build from scratch

## Migration Process & Best Practices

### Code Review Requirements

**Before Migration:**
1. Read source code in TJR repository
2. Identify dependencies and coupling
3. Check test coverage and fixtures
4. Validate against TJR transcripts

**During Migration:**
1. Copy code with attribution comments (source repo, commit SHA)
2. Preserve original tests and fixtures
3. Update imports/types for current monorepo structure
4. Run migrated tests to ensure functionality

**After Migration:**
1. Validate against TJR transcripts
2. Document any deviations from original implementation
3. Create integration tests combining migrated + new components
4. Update CLAUDE.md with migration notes

### Attribution & Documentation

All migrated code will include header comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Migrated from Nice-Wolf-Studio/TJR repository
 * Original package: @tjr/analysis-kit
 * Commit: [SHA]
 * Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
 *
 * Original implementation by Nice Wolf Studio
 * Adapted for tjr-suite monorepo
 */
```

### Testing Strategy

**Migrated Code Testing:**
1. Port all original unit tests from TJR repo
2. Add integration tests against TJR transcripts
3. Create golden fixtures for deterministic validation
4. Validate edge cases (gaps, equal values, missing data)

**New Code Testing:**
1. TDD approach (write tests first)
2. Validate against TJR transcript examples
3. Golden fixtures for complex scenarios

## Revised Timeline with Migration

**Original Estimate (ADR-0318):** 22-32 weeks

**Revised Estimate with Migration:** 18-26 weeks (4-6 weeks saved)

| Phase | Original Estimate | With Migration | Time Saved |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | 4-6 weeks | **2-3 weeks** | 2-3 weeks |
| Phase 2: Pattern Recognition | 4-6 weeks | **3-4 weeks** | 1-2 weeks |
| Phase 3: Multi-Symbol | 3-4 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 0 weeks |
| Phase 4: Daily Bias Engine | 4-6 weeks | **3-5 weeks** | 1 week |
| Phase 5: Execution Logic | 3-4 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 0 weeks |
| Phase 6: Backtesting | 4-6 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 0 weeks |
| **Total** | **22-32 weeks** | **18-26 weeks** | **4-6 weeks** |

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Faster time-to-market:** 4-6 weeks saved by migrating proven code
2. **Higher quality foundation:** Swing detection and FVG detection already tested
3. **Reduced risk:** Migrated code has prior validation, lower implementation risk
4. **Institutional knowledge:** Code embeds previous learnings about TJR's methodology
5. **Consistency:** Reusing same pure-function patterns across implementations

### Negative

1. **Technical debt risk:** Migrated code may have hidden assumptions or bugs
2. **Refactoring overhead:** Code may need updates to align with current architecture
3. **Testing burden:** Must validate migrated code AND new integrations
4. **Documentation gaps:** Original TJR repo may lack comprehensive docs
5. **Coupling risk:** Migrated code may have dependencies that don't translate

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Migrated code doesn't match TJR transcripts** | Validate against transcripts BEFORE integration, iterate until aligned |
| **Code has hidden dependencies** | Review all imports, create dependency map before migration |
| **Tests don't port cleanly** | Recreate tests from scratch if necessary, use migrated tests as reference |
| **Code quality below current standards** | Refactor during migration, apply strict linting/formatting |
| **Original implementation incomplete** | Extend with new development, don't assume migration is complete solution |

1. Collect candidates from session levels + HTF swings
2. Split by direction relative to reference price
3. Apply confluence banding (merges levels within 4 ticks)
4. Calculate priority scores for all levels
5. Sort deterministically (priority desc, distance asc)
6. Apply per-side target limits (default: 8 targets per side)

**Source Priority Weighting:**
- H4 swings: Highest priority
- H1 swings: Medium priority
- SESSION levels: Lower priority

**Scoring Factors:**
- Proximity to current price
- Recency (newer levels ranked higher)
- Source timeframe weight

**Key Methods:**
- `setSessionLevels(levels)` - Input from session boundary tracking
- `setHtfSwings(swings)` - Input from H1/H4 swing detection
- `build()` - Generate immutable plan with ranked targets
- `markLevelStatus(levelId, status)` - Runtime status updates (HIT/CONSUMED/PENDING)

- Performance tracking (processing time, memory usage)

**Swing Detection Algorithm:**
- Pivot bar must have highest high (for swing high) compared to left/right bars
- Confirmation period ensures non-repainting
- Supports both H1 and H4 timeframes simultaneously

**Key Methods:**
- `startDate(dateLocal)` - Initialize for trading date
- `onBar(htf, bar)` - Process H1 or H4 bar
- `latestConfirmed(htf, kind)` - Get most recent confirmed swing

### Revised Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: GladOSv2 Core (Weeks 1-3) - **PRIORITY**

**High-Priority Components:**
1. Session Levels Engine → `packages/strategy/session-levels.ts`
2. HTF Swing Detection → `packages/strategy/htf-swings.ts`
3. Break of Structure Engine → `packages/strategy/bos.ts`
4. Pivot Tracker → `packages/strategy/pivots.ts`

**Migration Steps:**
- Copy source files with attribution headers
- Port type definitions to `@tjr/contracts`
- Migrate Jest tests (keep Jest or convert to Node test runner)
- Validate against TJR transcripts (09/30/2025 trade)

#### Phase 2: Daily Bias + Fibonacci (Weeks 4-5)

**Components:**
1. Daily Bias Planner → `packages/strategy/daily-bias.ts`
2. Fibonacci Suite (fib79, fib, fib-pivots) → `packages/strategy/fibonacci/`
3. Confluence Validator → `packages/strategy/confluence.ts`
4. Priority Scorer → `packages/strategy/priority.ts`

#### Phase 3: Signal Infrastructure (Weeks 6-8)

**Components:**
1. Signal Engine → `packages/signals/engine.ts`
2. Signal Processor → `packages/signals/processor.ts`
3. Quality Scorer → `packages/signals/quality.ts`
4. Alert System → `packages/alerts/`
5. Replay System → `packages/backtesting/replay.ts`

#### Phase 4: TJR Repository Supplements (Weeks 9-10)

**Components from TJR Repo:**
1. FVG Detection → Migrate from `@tjr/tjr-tools/detectFVGs`
2. Order Block Detection → Migrate from `@tjr/tjr-tools/detectOrderBlocks`

#### Phase 5: New Development (Weeks 11-18)

**Build from Scratch:**
1. SMT Divergence Detector (ES vs NASDAQ correlation)
2. Liquidity Sweep Identifier (wick penetration logic)
3. Inverse FVG Detector (guided by GladOSv2 type definitions)
4. Leading/Lagging Index Logic
5. Trend Phase Classifier (extension vs retrace)
6. Position Manager (partial exits, trailing stops)
7. Transcript Validator (compare algo signals to TJR's actual trades)

---

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. ✅ **Document GladOSv2 findings** (this addendum)
2. **Create comprehensive file inventory** from GladOSv2
3. **Set up attribution system** (header template for migrated code)
4. **Migrate Session Levels Engine** (Week 1)
5. **Migrate HTF Swing Detection** (Week 1-2)
6. **Migrate Break of Structure** (Week 2)
7. **Validate migrated components** against 09/30/2025 transcript
8. **Begin Daily Bias Planner migration** (Week 3)

### Critical Decisions Needed

1. **Test Framework:** Keep Jest (from GladOSv2) or convert to Node.js test runner (current standard)?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep Jest for migrated code, maintain consistency with GladOSv2
   - **Rationale:** Existing tests are comprehensive and well-written

2. **Module System:** GladOSv2 uses ES modules (`"type": "module"`), current repo uses CommonJS
   - **Recommendation:** Migrate to ES modules across entire monorepo
   - **Rationale:** Modern standard, better tree-shaking, aligns with GladOSv2

3. **Package Structure:** GladOSv2 is monolithic, current repo is modular packages
   - **Recommendation:** Extract GladOSv2 strategy code into `@tjr/strategy` package
   - **Rationale:** Maintain package boundaries, easier versioning

4. **Infrastructure Reuse:** GladOSv2 has Discord bot, alerts, charts - overlap with current implementation
   - **Recommendation:** Evaluate side-by-side, migrate superior implementation
   - **Rationale:** Avoid duplicate infrastructure, leverage best-of-breed
