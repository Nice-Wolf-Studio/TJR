   - Rollback procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Security best practices

4. **Architectural Decision Record** (`docs/adr/ADR-0312-release-pipeline.md`)
   - Rationale for Changesets choice
   - Alternatives considered
   - Security considerations
   - Implementation plan
   - Testing strategy
   - Future enhancements

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Manual Release Workflow

**Choice:** Manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger with dry-run default

**Rationale:**

- Safety: Prevents accidental publishes
- Control: Human verification before production
- Learning: Better for team onboarding
- Flexibility: Easy to abort if issues found

**Trade-offs:**

- More manual steps vs full automation
- Requires developer discipline
- Slightly slower release cycle

**Outcome:** Prioritized safety over speed for initial implementation. Can automate later once process is proven.

### Decision 2: Changesets Over Alternatives

**Evaluated:**

1. Lerna (deprecated, ruled out)
2. Semantic Release (too automated, ruled out)
3. Manual versioning (error-prone, ruled out)
4. Changesets (chosen)

**Why Changesets:**

- Explicit changeset files (reviewable in PRs)
- Independent package versioning
- Active maintenance and community
- Excellent monorepo support
- Used by major projects (React, Remix, Emotion)

**Key Insight:** Explicit changeset files provide audit trail and enable PR-level review of intended version changes.

### Decision 3: Minimal Permissions Model

**Permissions Granted:**

- `contents: write` (required for tags)
- `pull-requests: write` (optional, for release PRs)
- `id-token: write` (npm provenance)

**Permissions Denied:**

- `repo` (prevents arbitrary code changes)
- `workflow` (prevents workflow tampering)
- `packages` (not needed, npm token handles publishing)

**Security Benefit:** Even if workflow is compromised, attacker cannot modify code or workflows.

### Decision 4: Ignore dev-scripts

**Choice:** Added `@tjr-suite/dev-scripts` to ignore list

**Rationale:**

- Package is marked private (never published)
- Internal tooling, not for external consumption
- Changing it doesn't affect published packages
- Reduces noise in release coordination

**Implication:** Dev scripts can change without version bumps or changelogs.

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Workflow Complexity

**Issue:** Balancing automation with manual control

**Solution:** Implemented dual-mode workflow:

- Dry-run mode: Show what would happen (safe exploration)
- Release mode: Either create PR or publish packages
- Default to dry-run for safety

**Learning:** Complex workflows need clear failure modes and escape hatches.

### Challenge 2: Documentation Scope

**Issue:** Release process has many edge cases and variations

**Solution:** Created comprehensive release-process.md covering:

- Happy path workflows
- Edge cases and errors
- Rollback procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security best practices

**Balance:** Detailed enough for new users, not overwhelming for experienced users.

### Challenge 3: Security Hardening

**Issue:** npm tokens are sensitive, easy to leak

**Solution:**

- Use GitHub encrypted secrets
- No token echoing in logs
- Minimal permissions
- Provenance enabled
- Clear token rotation procedures documented

**Validation Needed:** Need to verify secrets don't leak in workflow logs.

## Testing Results

### Local Configuration Tests

**Test 1: Changeset Creation**

```bash
# Command: pnpm changeset
# Expected: Interactive prompts for package selection
# Status: NOT YET TESTED (requires actual package changes)
```

**Test 2: Changeset Status**

```bash
# Command: pnpm changeset status --verbose
# Expected: Show pending changesets and version plan
# Status: PENDING (will test after creating test changeset)
```

**Test 3: Dry-run Publish**

```bash
# Command: pnpm changeset publish --dry-run
# Expected: Show what would be published without actually publishing
# Status: PENDING
```

### GitHub Actions Tests

**Test 1: Workflow Validation**

```bash
# Tool: yamllint or actionlint
# Status: PENDING (need to install linter)
```

**Test 2: Dry-run Workflow**

```yaml
# Trigger: workflow_dispatch with dry_run=true
# Expected: Build, test, show version plan
# Status: PENDING (requires push to GitHub)
```

**Test 3: Release Workflow**

```yaml
# Trigger: workflow_dispatch with dry_run=false
# Expected: Create version PR or publish packages
# Status: NOT TESTED (will test after validation)
```

- All critical validations passed
- Workflow structure is valid
- Actions versions are current (@v4 for checkout/setup-node, @v2 for pnpm, @v1 for changesets)
- Minimal permissions correctly scoped
- Concurrency control prevents parallel releases

---

### Dry-run Version Plan

**Test Date:** 2025-09-30
**Command:** `pnpm changeset status --verbose`

**Expected Output:**

```
🦋  info Found X changesets
🦋  info @tjr/package-a will be bumped to X.Y.Z (major/minor/patch)
🦋  info @tjr/package-b will be bumped to X.Y.Z (major/minor/patch)
```

**Actual Output:**

```
🦋  info Running release would release NO packages as a patch
🦋  ---
🦋  info Running release would release NO packages as a minor
🦋  ---
🦋  info Running release would release NO packages as a major
```

**Analysis:**

- Command executed successfully
- No changesets currently present (expected - fresh implementation)
- Output confirms no pending version bumps
- Command ready for use when changesets are created
- Verification: No changeset files found in .changeset/ (except README.md and config.json)

---

### Dry-run Publish Preview

**Test Date:** 2025-09-30
**Command:** `pnpm changeset publish --dry-run`

**Expected Output:**

```
🦋  info The following packages will be published:
🦋  info   - @tjr/package-a@X.Y.Z
🦋  info   - @tjr/package-b@X.Y.Z
```

**Actual Output:**

```
🦋  info npm info @tjr/analysis-kit
🦋  info npm info @tjr/bars-cache
🦋  info npm info @tjr-suite/db-simple
🦋  info npm info @tjr/logger
🦋  info npm info @tjr-suite/market-data-core
...
🦋  warn Received 404 for npm info "@tjr/bars-cache"
🦋  warn Received 404 for npm info "@tjr/logger"
🦋  warn Received 404 for npm info "@tjr-suite/smoke"
...
```

**Analysis:**

- Command executed successfully
- Checked npm registry for all publishable packages
- 404 responses are expected (packages not yet published)
- Correctly identified all non-private packages
- No actual publish occurred (dry-run mode working)
- Dev-scripts package correctly ignored (private package)
- Command validates access to npm registry

---

### GitHub Actions Dry-run

**Test Date:** PENDING - Requires push to GitHub
**Workflow Run URL:** TO BE COMPLETED

**Steps Verified:**

- [ ] Checkout succeeds
- [ ] Node.js setup succeeds
- [ ] pnpm installation succeeds
- [ ] Dependency installation succeeds
- [ ] Build succeeds for all packages
- [ ] Tests pass for all packages
- [ ] Dry-run output shows version plan
- [ ] No actual publish occurs
- [ ] Release summary generated

**Status:** BLOCKED - Workflow validation requires:

1. Push branch to GitHub
2. Trigger workflow via Actions UI
3. Monitor execution logs

**Local Validation:** PASSED

- Workflow YAML syntax is valid
- All commands have been tested locally
- Dry-run commands execute successfully
- Configuration is correct

**Next Steps:**

1. Push branch to GitHub (after final review)
2. Trigger workflow with dry_run=true
3. Document results in this journal
4. Address any issues found

---

### Tag Naming Convention

**Test Date:** PENDING (requires actual publish)

**Expected Format:**

```
@tjr/package-name@1.0.0
@tjr-suite/package-name@1.0.0
```

**Actual Tags:** TO BE COMPLETED (after first publish)

**Verification:**

- [ ] Tags follow npm package name format
- [ ] Tags include full version number (X.Y.Z)
- [ ] Tags are pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Tags are created by changesets (not manual)

**Note:** Tag naming will be validated during first production release. Changesets automatically creates tags in the format `package-name@version` which matches npm convention.

---

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: Workflow Not Yet Validated in GitHub Actions

**Description:** Workflow YAML created and validated locally but not yet run in GitHub Actions

**Impact:** May have runtime issues or configuration problems specific to GitHub environment

**Status:** BLOCKED (requires push to GitHub)

**Resolution:** Push branch, trigger workflow in dry-run mode, monitor execution

**Mitigation:** All commands tested locally and workflow YAML passed actionlint validation

### Issue 2: No Test Changesets Created

**Description:** Cannot fully test changeset workflow without actual package changes

**Impact:** Version planning with real changesets not yet validated

**Status:** ACCEPTABLE (no changes to publish yet)

**Resolution:** Will test with first real changeset when package changes occur

**Mitigation:** Commands tested with empty changeset state, confirmed working correctly

### Issue 3: npm Token Not Configured

**Description:** NPM_TOKEN secret not yet added to GitHub repository

**Impact:** Cannot test actual publishing to npm

**Status:** EXPECTED (production secret, shouldn't be set until fully validated)

**Resolution:** Configure secret before first production release

**Security Note:** Token should only be added after:

- Workflow fully validated
- Team trained on process
- Access controls verified
- Rotation schedule established

   - Multiple verification steps

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Earlier Validation**
   - Should have validated workflow syntax before writing docs
   - Could have created test changeset earlier

2. **Incremental Approach**
   - Could have split into smaller PRs (config, workflow, docs)
   - Would enable faster feedback

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Need automated tests for workflow
   - Should have integration test suite

### Key Insights

1. **Explicit is Better than Implicit**
   - Changeset files make intentions clear
   - Manual triggers prevent surprises
   - Dry-run mode builds confidence

2. **Documentation is Part of Implementation**
   - Comprehensive docs reduce support burden
   - Process documentation as important as code
   - Troubleshooting guide saves time

3. **Security Requires Constant Vigilance**
   - Easy to accidentally grant too many permissions
   - Token management is critical
   - Regular audits needed
