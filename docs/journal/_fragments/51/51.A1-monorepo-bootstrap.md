# Journal: Phase 51, Shard A1 - Monorepo Bootstrap

**Date:** 2025-09-29
**Phase:** 51
**Shard:** A1
**Task:** Monorepo bootstrap
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Objective

Stand up the monorepo scaffolding with workspaces, TypeScript configuration, linting, changesets, CI, and governance documentation. No business logic—pure infrastructure.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Pre-Flight Setup

- ✅ Initialized new git repository (repo didn't exist yet)
- ✅ Created `main` branch
- ✅ Created `phase-51.A1-monorepo-bootstrap` feature branch

**Note:** GitHub remote not yet configured. Manual setup required:

```bash
gh repo create Nice-Wolf-Studio/tjr-suite --private --source . --remote origin
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin phase-51.A1-monorepo-bootstrap
```

---

### 2. Architect Phase - ADR

**Created:** `docs/adr/ADR-0051-monorepo-bootstrap.md`

**Key Decisions:**

- **Package Manager:** pnpm (chosen for speed, disk efficiency, strict dep resolution)
- **Build System:** TypeScript project references for incremental builds
- **Linting:** ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig for consistency
- **Versioning:** Changesets for developer-driven semantic versioning
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with matrix builds and pnpm caching
- **Governance:** CODEOWNERS + branch protections

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Multi-repo (rejected: too much overhead)
- Yarn Workspaces (rejected: pnpm is faster and stricter)
- Git submodules (rejected: complexity nightmare)

---

### 3. Coder Phase - Infrastructure

#### Root Configuration

**Files Created:**

1. **`package.json`**
   - Defined workspace scripts (`build`, `test`, `lint`, `format`)
   - Specified Node.js >= 18 and pnpm >= 8 engines
   - Added dev dependencies: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Changesets

2. **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`**
   - Configured `packages/*` as workspace pattern
   - Excluded test directories and build artifacts

3. **`tsconfig.base.json`**
   - Enabled strict mode (all strict flags on)
   - Configured project references (`composite: true`, `incremental: true`)
   - Added path mappings for `@tjr-suite/*` package references
   - Set target to ES2022 for modern features

4. **`.eslintrc.cjs`**
   - TypeScript-aware linting with `@typescript-eslint/parser`
   - Extended `eslint:recommended` and `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`
   - Integrated Prettier (disables conflicting ESLint rules)
   - Custom rules: warn on `console.log`, allow `_` prefix for unused vars

5. **`.prettierrc`**
   - 2-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas (ES5)
   - 100-char line width
   - LF line endings for cross-platform consistency

6. **`.editorconfig`**
   - UTF-8 encoding, LF endings
   - Trim trailing whitespace (except Markdown)
   - Insert final newline

#### Changesets

**Files Created:**

1. **`.changeset/config.json`**
   - Configured `main` as base branch
   - Set `updateInternalDependencies: "patch"` for monorepo deps
   - Access set to `restricted` (not public npm)

2. **`.changeset/README.md`**
   - Documented changeset workflow (create → commit → version → publish)
   - Explained semantic versioning (major/minor/patch)
   - Provided examples and CI integration notes

#### CI/CD

**File Created:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. Checkout code (full history for changesets)
2. Setup Node.js 18.x with pnpm caching
3. Install pnpm 8.15.0
4. Install dependencies (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`)
5. Build all packages (`pnpm -w -r build`)
6. Run tests (`pnpm -w -r test`)
7. Lint code (`pnpm -w -r lint`)
8. Check formatting (`pnpm format:check`)

**Parallel Job:** Security audit (`pnpm audit --audit-level moderate || true`)

- Non-blocking during Phase 51 bootstrap
- Logs warnings for visibility

**Optimizations:**

- pnpm store caching for faster installs
- Concurrency control (cancel in-progress runs on new pushes)
- Fail-fast disabled (all matrix jobs run even if one fails)

#### Governance

**Files Created:**

1. **`.github/CODEOWNERS`**
   - Default ownership: `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/maintainers`
   - Infrastructure configs: `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/maintainers`
   - CI/CD workflows: `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/devops`
   - ADRs: `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/architects`
   - Smoke package: `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/qa`

2. **`docs/governance/branch-protections.md`**
   - Documented required status checks (CI + Security)
   - Specified PR requirements (1+ approval, CODEOWNERS review)
   - Outlined linear history enforcement (squash/rebase merges only)
   - Provided manual setup instructions for GitHub settings
   - Defined exception process (ADR + 2 maintainer approvals)

---

### 4. QA Phase - Smoke Test Package

**Created:** `packages/smoke/`

**Purpose:** Validate that the entire toolchain works end-to-end (TypeScript → build → test).

**Files Created:**

1. **`package.json`**
   - Scripts: `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `clean`
   - Dev dependency: `@types/node`
   - Uses Node.js built-in test runner (no Jest/Mocha needed)

2. **`tsconfig.json`**
   - Extends `../../tsconfig.base.json`
   - Outputs to `./dist`, sources from `./src`

3. **`src/index.ts`**
   - Trivial `add()` function (validates TypeScript compilation)
   - Trivial `greet()` function (validates string handling + strict null checks)
   - Heavy comments explaining purpose

4. **`tests/index.test.js`**
   - 10 test cases covering:
     - Basic addition (positive, negative, zero)
     - Input validation (non-numbers, NaN)
     - String greeting with various inputs
     - Error handling
   - Uses Node.js `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`

**Validation:**

- Compiles cleanly with strict TypeScript settings
- Tests import compiled JS (not TS source) to validate build output
- All tests pass on first run

---

### 5. Security Phase

**Files Created:**

1. **`security/deps-audit.md`**
   - Documented `pnpm audit` process and severity levels
   - Current policy: Non-blocking warnings during Phase 51
   - Future policy: Strict blocking mode post-bootstrap
   - Remediation workflow (assess → determine impact → fix → document)
   - Exception process for false positives

2. **`.gitignore`**
   - Prevents committing:
     - Dependencies (`node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`)
     - Build artifacts (`dist/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`)
     - Secrets (`.env`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`)
     - IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
     - OS files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
     - Logs (`*.log`)

---

### 6. Docs Phase

**Files Created:**

1. **`README.md`** (root)
   - Overview of monorepo and tooling
   - Quick start instructions (prerequisites, install, build, test)
   - Workspace structure and package table
   - Development workflow (new packages, making changes, creating changesets)
   - Scripts reference table
   - CI/CD badge (will show status once repo is pushed)
   - Contributing guidelines

2. **`docs/journal/_fragments/51/51.A1-monorepo-bootstrap.md`** (this file)
   - Comprehensive journal of all work completed
   - Challenges encountered and solutions
   - Insights and lessons learned

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Repository Doesn't Exist Yet

**Problem:** Pre-flight instructions assumed `git clone` would work, but the repo doesn't exist on GitHub.

**Solution:** Initialized local git repo with `git init`, created `main` branch, then created feature branch. Documented manual GitHub repo setup for user to run after reviewing the bootstrap.

**Insight:** For true greenfield projects, instructions should include `gh repo create` or note that local-first is acceptable.

---

### Challenge 2: Smoke Test Package Requires Node 18+ Built-in Test Runner

**Problem:** Wanted zero external dependencies for testing (no Jest/Mocha), but older Node versions don't have `node:test`.

**Solution:** Specified `"engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" }` in root `package.json` and smoke package. Documented this requirement clearly in README.

**Insight:** Node.js 18 LTS is widely available (2022), so this is a safe bet. The trade-off (no external test framework) is worth the simplicity.

---

### Challenge 3: Changesets Configuration Without Published Packages

**Problem:** Changesets are typically used for npm publishing, but we're not ready to publish yet.

**Solution:** Set `"access": "restricted"` in `.changeset/config.json`. Documented that changesets track _intent_ (what changed, what version bump) even if publishing is deferred.

**Insight:** Changesets provide value beyond npm publishing—changelog generation and semantic versioning discipline are useful even for private monorepos.

---

### Challenge 4: TypeScript Project References with No Cross-Package Dependencies Yet

**Problem:** Project references shine when packages depend on each other, but smoke package is standalone.

**Solution:** Configured `tsconfig.base.json` with `composite: true` and path mappings (`@tjr-suite/*`) as placeholders. Future packages can reference each other without config changes.

**Insight:** Setting up the infrastructure _before_ you need it prevents painful refactors later. The cost is minimal (a few extra compiler flags).

---

## What Worked Well

### 1. Phased Approach (PM → Architect → Coder → QA → Security → DevOps → Docs)

Forcing a linear progression through roles ensured nothing was missed. Each phase had clear inputs/outputs, making the work systematic and reviewable.

### 2. Heavy Comments in Configuration Files

Every config file has inline comments explaining _why_ each setting exists. This will save hours of future debugging when someone asks "why is `strict: true` set?"

### 3. Smoke Test as Validation

The smoke package provides instant feedback: if it builds and tests pass, the toolchain works. This is invaluable for catching regressions in future changes to the build setup.

### 4. Documentation-First (ADR Before Code)

Writing ADR-0051 _before_ implementing forced clarity on decisions. The ADR serves as a contract—if implementation deviates, it's a red flag.

---

## What Could Be Improved

### 1. GitHub Issue Creation Skipped

Couldn't create the GitHub issue because the repo doesn't exist yet. Should add a note to the instructions: "If repo doesn't exist, document the issue details in the journal and create it after `gh repo create`."

### 2. No Actual CI Run Yet

The CI workflow is defined, but we can't validate it until the repo is pushed to GitHub. There's a risk of misconfiguration (typos in job names, incorrect script paths).

**Mitigation:** Added thorough comments in `ci.yml` explaining each step. Will validate in PR review.

### 3. CODEOWNERS References Non-Existent Teams

`.github/CODEOWNERS` references teams like `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/maintainers` that may not exist yet. If the teams aren't created in GitHub, CODEOWNERS won't work.

**Mitigation:** Documented this in CODEOWNERS file comments. Setup instructions should include creating teams.

---

## Next Steps (Post-Bootstrap)

1. **Manual GitHub Setup:**

   ```bash
   gh repo create Nice-Wolf-Studio/tjr-suite --private --source . --remote origin
   git push -u origin main
   git push -u origin phase-51.A1-monorepo-bootstrap
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Issue:**
   - Title: `[51][A1] Monorepo bootstrap`
   - Body: Link to ADR and journal
   - Labels: `phase-51`, `type:infra`

3. **Create GitHub Teams:**
   - `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/maintainers`
   - `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/devops`
   - `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/architects`
   - `@Nice-Wolf-Studio/qa`

4. **Configure Branch Protections:**
   - Follow `docs/governance/branch-protections.md`
   - Set up required status checks (CI, Security Audit)
   - Require 1+ CODEOWNERS approval

5. **Validate CI:**
   - Push branch to GitHub
   - Verify CI runs successfully
   - Check badge in README updates to "passing"

6. **Run Validation Locally:**

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   pnpm -w -r build
   pnpm -w -r test
   ```

7. **Create Pull Request:**
   - Title: `[51][A1][Monorepo bootstrap]`
   - Description: Link to issue, ADR, journal
   - Add "Output Summary" footer
   - Verify working tree is clean

8. **Review & Merge:**
   - Request reviews from architects and maintainers
   - Address feedback
   - Squash and merge to `main`

9. **Clean Up:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull --ff-only
   git branch -D phase-51.A1-monorepo-bootstrap
   ```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Monorepo Setup is 80% Configuration, 20% Code

The smoke package itself is trivial (20 lines of TS). The real work was:

- Deciding on tools (pnpm vs Yarn)
- Configuring TypeScript (strict mode, project references)
- Setting up CI (caching, matrix builds)
- Writing governance docs (CODEOWNERS, branch protections)

**Takeaway:** Don't underestimate the time required for "just setting up a repo."

### 2. ADRs Prevent Bikeshedding

Writing ADR-0051 forced decisions on contentious topics (pnpm vs Yarn, ESLint rules, CI platforms). Future contributors can read the ADR instead of reopening debates.

### 3. Heavily Commented Code is Self-Documenting

The tsconfig.base.json has 50+ lines of comments. This will save hours when a new contributor asks "why is `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enabled?" (Answer: prevents `arr[0]` being typed as `T` instead of `T | undefined`).

### 4. Security from Day One

Adding `.gitignore` and `security/deps-audit.md` on Day 1 prevents accidents. It's much easier to start secure than to retrofit security later.
