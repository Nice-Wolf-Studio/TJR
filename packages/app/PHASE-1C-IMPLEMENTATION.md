# Phase 1C: Intent-based Security Validation - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented intent-based security validation to ensure the Discord bot only processes trading-related queries and rejects potentially dangerous administrative or general queries.

## Files Created

### 1. `/packages/app/src/services/intent-classifier.service.ts` (New)

**Purpose:** Classify and validate user prompts for security

**Key Components:**
- `PromptIntent` enum: TRADING_QUERY, ADMIN_QUERY, GENERAL_QUERY
- `TRADING_KEYWORDS`: 70+ trading-specific keywords (market, bias, ES, NQ, trade, journal, etc.)
- `BLOCKED_KEYWORDS`: 35+ dangerous keywords (table, schema, database, drop, deploy, credentials, etc.)
- `classifyIntent(prompt)`: Returns intent classification
- `validatePrompt(prompt)`: Returns validation result with helpful error messages
- `getBlockedKeywords(prompt)`: Debug helper for logging
- `getTradingKeywords(prompt)`: Debug helper for logging

**Security Features:**
- Case-insensitive keyword matching
- Rejects database operations (DROP, DELETE, ALTER, etc.)
- Rejects infrastructure commands (deploy, restart, docker, etc.)
- Rejects auth/credential queries
- Rejects code/repo operations (git push, merge, etc.)
- Provides user-friendly rejection messages

### 2. `/packages/app/tests/intent-classifier.test.ts` (New)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive test suite for intent classifier

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Correctly classifies trading queries
- ✅ Correctly classifies admin queries as blocked
- ✅ Correctly classifies general queries
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Validates trading queries as valid
- ✅ Rejects admin queries with helpful message
- ✅ Rejects general queries with helpful message
- ✅ Handles empty/null prompts
- ✅ Returns matched blocked keywords
- ✅ Returns matched trading keywords

**Test Results:** 13/13 tests passing ✅

## Files Modified

### 3. `/packages/app/src/services/claude-prompt-processor.ts`

**Changes:**
- Updated `buildSystemPrompt()` with strict trading-only boundaries
- Added **STRICT SCOPE: TRADING ONLY** section defining allowed topics
- Added **SECURITY BOUNDARIES** section with 7 explicit refusal rules
- Added **SUPABASE USAGE RULES** to prevent database abuse
- Updated system instructions to politely decline non-trading queries

**Security Enhancements:**
- Claude now has explicit instructions to refuse admin operations
- Clear boundaries around Supabase usage (read-only, trading data only)
- Prevents GitHub modifications, file system access, code execution
- Rejects auth/credential queries at the prompt level

### 4. `/packages/app/src/server/http-server.ts`

**Changes:**
- Imported `IntentClassifierService`
- Added `intentClassifier` as class property
- Modified `/api/ask` endpoint to validate prompts BEFORE processing
- Returns HTTP 403 for rejected prompts with detailed reason
- Logs rejected prompts with matched blocked keywords
- Logs accepted prompts with matched trading keywords

**Request Flow:**
1. Validate prompt is non-empty string
2. **NEW: Classify and validate intent** ← Security gate
3. Reject with 403 if validation fails
4. Process with Claude if validation passes
5. Return response

## Security Model

### Defense in Depth - Two Layers

**Layer 1: HTTP Server (Pre-Claude)**
- Intent classifier validates prompt before it reaches Claude
- Blocks admin/general queries immediately
- Returns helpful error messages to users
- Logs all rejection attempts for monitoring

**Layer 2: Claude System Prompt (AI-level)**
- Claude has explicit instructions to refuse non-trading queries
- Acts as fallback if classifier misses something
- Provides natural language refusal with context
- Prevents tool misuse through prompt engineering

### Keyword-based Classification

**Trading Keywords (70+):**
- Market identifiers: ES, NQ, SPY, QQQ, futures
- Trading concepts: trade, journal, position, entry, exit, stop, risk, pnl
- Market structure: price, support, resistance, trend, breakout
- TJR-specific: day profile, session extremes, value area, POC
- Analysis: chart, indicator, signal, pattern, strategy

**Blocked Keywords (35+):**
- Database: table, schema, drop, delete, truncate, alter
- Infrastructure: deploy, server, docker, kubernetes, aws
- Security: credentials, password, token, api key, auth
- System: restart, shutdown, sudo, chmod
- Code: git push, pull request, merge

## Example Behaviors

### ✅ Accepted (Trading)
```
"What is the ES market bias?"
"Show me NQ session extremes"
"Analyze SPY trade setup"
"What are the current support and resistance levels?"
```

### ❌ Rejected (Admin)
```
"Show me the database schema"
"Drop table users"
"Deploy the application"
"What are the user credentials?"
→ Returns: "This bot is designed for trading analysis only. Administrative or system queries are not allowed for security reasons."
```

### ❌ Rejected (General)
```
"What is the weather today?"
"Tell me a joke"
"How do I cook pasta?"
→ Returns: "This bot is specialized for trading analysis. Please ask questions about markets, trading, or TJR analysis."
```

## Logging and Monitoring

All rejected prompts are logged with:
- Prompt preview (first 100 chars)
- Rejection reason
- Matched blocked keywords
- User ID and Channel ID (for audit trail)

All accepted prompts are logged with:
- Prompt preview
- Matched trading keywords
- User ID and Channel ID

## Testing Verification

```bash
cd /Users/jeremymiranda/Dev/TJR\ Project/6/tjr-suite
pnpm --filter @tjr/app test tests/intent-classifier.test.ts

✓ tests/intent-classifier.test.ts (13 tests) 3ms
  Test Files  1 passed (1)
       Tests  13 passed (13)
```

## Build Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter @tjr/app build
# Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
```

## Integration Points

1. **HTTP Server** → Uses `IntentClassifierService` in `/api/ask` endpoint
2. **Claude Processor** → Enhanced system prompt with security boundaries
3. **Logger** → Captures all validation decisions for audit trail
4. **MCP Tools** → Protected by both layers (classifier + Claude prompt)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Rate Limiting**: Add per-user rate limits to prevent abuse
2. **Metrics**: Track rejection rates by intent type
3. **Dynamic Keywords**: Allow runtime updates to keyword lists
4. **ML Classification**: Replace keyword matching with ML model
5. **User Allowlist**: Special handling for admin users
6. **Tool-level Validation**: Add intent checking to individual MCP tools

## Security Validation Status

✅ Intent classification implemented
✅ Prompt validation active in HTTP endpoint
✅ Claude system prompt hardened
✅ Comprehensive test coverage
✅ Logging and monitoring in place
✅ Build verified successful
