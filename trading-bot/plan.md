  - Database: PostgreSQL for structured data + Redis for real-time caching
  - API Layer: Express.js for webhook endpoints
  - Data Sources: TradingView webhooks + Alpha Vantage/Polygon.io for historical data
  - Hosting: DigitalOcean droplet or AWS EC2 with auto-scaling
  - Monitoring: Winston logging + Prometheus metrics

  1.3 Initial Commands Implementation

  - !ping - Bot health check
  - !help - Command documentation
  - !bias [pair] - Basic daily bias (simplified version)
  - !levels [pair] - Session highs/lows marking

  Phase 2: Data Collection & Analysis Engine (Weeks 5-8)

  2.1 Data Pipeline Architecture

  - Real-time Stream: TradingView webhook → Express endpoint → Redis → Analysis engine
  - Historical Data: Scheduled jobs pulling OHLCV data for multiple timeframes
  - Data Validation: Integrity checks, gap detection, outlier filtering
  - Storage Strategy: Hot data (Redis) + Warm data (PostgreSQL) + Cold data (file storage)

  2.2 Analysis Modules Development

  Liquidity Scanner Module

  // Core functionality to identify:
  - Equal highs/lows detection algorithm
  - Session extreme identification
  - Psychological level mapping (00/50 levels)
  - Trendline liquidity calculation

  Structure Analyzer Module

  // Pattern recognition for:
  - Higher highs/higher lows detection
  - Break of structure identification
  - Swing point mapping
  - Trend classification across timeframes

  Confluence Scorer Module

  // Weighted scoring system:
  - Tier 1 confluences (3x weight)
  - Tier 2 confluences (2x weight)
  - Tier 3 confluences (1x weight)
  - Dynamic score calculation

  2.3 Enhanced Commands

  - !setup [timeframe] - Real-time opportunity identification
  - !flow [pair] - Order flow analysis
  - !confluence [pair] - Detailed confluence breakdown

  Phase 3: Intelligence & Optimization (Weeks 9-12)

  3.1 Advanced Analysis Features

  - Candlestick Intelligence: 7-layer candle analysis implementation
  - Session Analytics: Capital flow modeling by trading session
  - SMT Divergence: Cross-market correlation analysis (indices only)
  - Fair Value Gap Detection: Imbalance identification algorithm

  3.2 Risk Management Integration

  - Position Sizing Calculator: Dynamic risk-based calculations
  - Stop Loss Optimizer: Structure-based placement algorithm
  - Performance Tracker: Win rates, R multiples, drawdown analysis

  3.3 Alert System Enhancement

  - Smart Notifications: Context-aware alert filtering
  - User Preferences: Customizable alert thresholds
  - Multi-channel Support: Discord DM + channel notifications
  - Alert Backtesting: Historical performance validation

  Technical Architecture Details

  Database Schema Design

  -- Core tables structure
  markets (id, symbol, timeframe, session)
  price_data (timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume)
  liquidity_levels (level, strength, type, session)
  confluences (timestamp, type, weight, score)
  user_preferences (user_id, pairs, alert_thresholds)
  performance_metrics (date, setup_type, outcome, rr_ratio)

  API Integration Strategy

  1. Primary Data Source: TradingView webhooks for real-time signals
  2. Backup Sources: Polygon.io for US markets, Alpha Vantage for forex
  3. Rate Limiting: Implement exponential backoff with circuit breakers
  4. Error Handling: Graceful degradation with cached data fallback

  Scalability Considerations

  - Horizontal Scaling: Load balancer + multiple bot instances
  - Caching Strategy: Multi-layer caching (Redis + in-memory)
  - Queue Management: Bull queue for background job processing
  - Database Optimization: Indexing strategy + read replicas
